 As of May 2020, a total of 133 Olympic medals (42 gold, 43 silver and 48 bronze) have been retroactively stripped from athletes for a variety of offences at the Summer Games. Most* of these offences were related to doping, usually where banned substances were found in urine samples, but also where athletes tampered with their urine sample or failed to provide a valid sample on time (and a small number of non-doping related offences). The death of Danish cyclist Knud Enemark Jensen during the Team Time Trial in 1960 led to the formation of an Olympic medical committee in 1961; this committee then introduced drug testing at the Summer Olympics in 1968. The first athlete to have a medal rescinded as a result of these tests was Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall in 1968; the Swede had two beers to calm his nerves before a shooting event, but had inadvertently consumed an illegal amount of alcohol. Since then, a number of other athletes (or their horses) have accidentally or unknowingly taken banned substances, but evidence suggests that a great deal more have done so intentionally and deceitfully. The first high-profile athlete to be stripped of their medal was Canada's Ben Johnson, following his victory in the 100m sprint in 1988. The scandal rocked the world of sport, was covered heavily by news outlets across the world, and increased public awareness and knowledge of the use of steroids in top-level sports. BALCO and Team USA in 2000 Athletes representing the US have been stripped of ten medals in total, with seven of these coming in the 2000 Games in Sydney alone, and five of these were from just one athlete. A 2002 federal investigation into the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative found that the lab was providing many professional and Olympic athletes with prohibited substances. When investigators were anonymously provided with a syringe containing unknown substances, this allowed them to trace the materials back to other athletes' samples, who were speedily implicated and charged. The anonymous whistleblower turned out to be the running coach of Marion Jones, who took gold in the 100m, 200m, and 4x400m, and bronze in the Long Jump and 4x100m in Sydney. The investigation did not immediately incriminate Jones, further testing led to her admission of guilt in 2007, and she subsequently turned over her five Olympic medals. Although Jones had won two of her medals in team events, her co-competitors had their medals restored to them in 2010 as the rules in 2000 did not punish teams for the actions of one member. This ruling also benefitted the men's 4x400 team, who had been stripped of their medals in 2004 for the actions of one of the runners in the heats and semi-finals. The men's team's records and medals were restored the following year, but the team was then re-stripped of their medals in 2008 when another member (who ran in the final) also admitted to doping. The seventh medal was stripped from Lance Armstrong, who won the bronze in Individual Time Trial; Armstrong returned his medal in 2013, following the development of the largest doping scandal relating to any individual athlete in any sport. Russian doping scandal While the Soviet Union and Eastern European states had a history of state-sponsored doping programs throughout the 1970s and 1980s, their doping methods were usually one step ahead of the testing methods, and were difficult to prove (in the past twenty years these countries have had more medals stripped than the rest of the world combined). WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency, was formed in 1999 by the IOC, and is the world's leading organization in the fight against doping in sports. Their actions in the past two decades have led to large improvements in testing methods and regulations, and they have helped to identify many cheats throughout this time. In spite of this, it was not until Russian whistleblowers came forward in the early 2010s that the largest doping scandal in the world came to light. Starting in 2010, a small number of athletes and testing officials reported that RUSADA (the Russian Anti-Doping Agency) was deliberately working against WADA to help athletes cheat and conceal this from testing authorities. The allegations implicated many renowned athletes and high-ranking testing officials, and even indicated that President Vladimir Putin was aware of these activities. In the wake of these revelations and WADA's investigations, 145 Russian athletes have been added to the "most suspicious" list, and have been banned from taking part in any major athletics tournaments. Since 2010, Russian athletes have been stripped of more medals than any other country, 29 medals were stripped from Russian competitors relating to the 2008 and 2012 games alone. On December 2019, WADA announced that RUSADA were still non-compliant with international procedures and regulations, and Russia would be banned from all major sporting events for a period of four years. WADA did, however, put provisions in place to ensure that no innocent Russian athletes would be punished, and allows any Russian athlete wishing to participate in the Tokyo Games to do so, provided they have been individually cleared by WADA and that they compete under a neutral banner.

Both financial figures hit a peak in 2012 of around 48.02 and 10.8 billion U.S. dollars, respectively. When was the Coca-Cola Company founded? The Coca-Cola Company is a producer, retailer and marketer of non-alcoholic beverages and is well-known for its soft drink, Coca-Cola. The history of Coca-Cola began in 1886 when Atlanta pharmacist Dr. John S. Pemberton created a flavored syrup with a distinctive taste. The company went on to be founded in 1892 and comprises the corporate division, which is headquartered in Atlanta, GA. Almost one third of the Coca-Cola Companyâ€™s revenue was produced in North America in 2019. Coca-Cola's sales volume growth, however, is most prominent in the Asia Pacific region. Employment at the Coca-Cola Company As with both revenue and income, the number of Coca-Cola employees has risen and fallen in recent years. In 2019, over 85,000 people were employed by the company, whilst employment peaked in 2012 at over 150,000.

In total, the world saw a decrease of malaria cases from 262,000 in the year 2000 to 214,000 in the year 2015. Africa, the region with the most cases of Malaria, saw a decrease over the same period from 214,000 to 188,000. In a worldwide survey of global travelers Malaria was found to be the third most concerning health risk for travelers, with insect-borne fevers, such as Dengue ranking number two behind Ebola. The latest outbreak of the Zika virus in South and Central America also shows the challenge of fighting mosquito-borne diseases. The Zika virus has been linked to a rise in microcephaly among newborns, a neurodevelopmental disorder which ultimately can result in severely impaired intellectual development and other neurological dysfunctions such as hyperactivity, convulsions, etc. As of 2015, over two million people worldwide were living in areas environmentally suitable for Zika virus transmission, with Asia accounting for 1.4 million of the at-risk population. In 2015 alone, mosquitoes were responsible for 755,000 human deaths, making them the most deadly creatures worldwide, far ahead of the second most deadly creature, snails, with 200,000 human deaths.

 The number of mobile devices operating worldwide is expected to reach 17.72 billion by 2024, an increase of 3.7 billion devices compared to 2020 levels. Moving forward with 5G As the number of devices grows, so does our dependence on them to fulfill daily functions and activities. The use cases for mobile devices increasingly demand faster connection speeds and lower latency. The 5G network will be critical to fulfilling those demands, operating at significantly faster rates than 4G. In North America, for example, it is expected that up to 40 percent of all connections will be made over the 5G standard, up from just four percent in 2020. Globally, this figure should reach 20.1 percent by 2025. 6G: looking beyond 5G While 5G has entered commercialization and is already creating new opportunities, researchers and engineers are already experimenting with 6G. Not only will the number of mobile devices continue to grow but cellular internet-of-things (IoT) devices are set to permeate more industrial sectors in the coming years, meaning a solution will eventually be required for network congestion and data transfer speeds. 6G ought to be capable of solving those problems before they arise, potentially enabling a network connection density ten times greater than that of 5G, and peak data rates up to fifty times faster than the rate of 5G. The Federal Communications Commission in the United States has opened spectrum for experimentation, and China have already launched what is described as a 6G satellite, so that actual potential of 6G should be revealed over the coming decade.

Apple iPod sales - additional information Introduced to the consumer market in 2001, Apple revolutionized the music industry with its pocket-sized music player iPod. Since its release, the iPod has been one of the most dominant products within the digital music player market, with total aggregate unit sales of nearly 360 million. The market for portable music players, however, has been slowing down in recent years. Appleâ€™s own sales figures essentially follow the existing overall trend, as iPods sales worldwide have been dropping since 2010. The company still experiences a consistent sales peak in the first quarter of the companyâ€™s own financial year. For Apple, the first quarter of their financial year is from early October to late December â€?just around the holiday season. The increased capacity of smartphones to play and store music as a multi-functional device has been pinpointed by industry experts as the main reason for the decline of digital music devices sales. This explanation seems fitting when looking at Appleâ€™s devices sales figures over the years. iPod sales have decreased as iPhone and iPad sales have increased in the last few years. Up until the third quarter of 2010, Apple still sold more iPods than iPhones. In the last quarter of 2014, iPod sales accounted for only about one percent of Apple's total revenue. The declining of iPod sales has not had a negative impact on the company. As the share of the companyâ€™s total revenue made from iPod sales has decreased, strong sales of the iPad and the iPhone have allowed the company to maintain a dominant position in many markets worldwide. In 2014, Apple announced its highest annual revenue to date.

 The U.S. presidential election has been held in North Carolina on 57 occasions; this was every election except the first, in 1789, and the 1864 election, when North Carolina was a member of the Confederate States of America. North Carolina has awarded all (or at least a majority) of its electoral votes to the nationwide winning candidate in 38 elections, giving a success rate of 67 percent. The "Tar Heel State" has voted for the Democratic nominee in thirty elections, and the Republican nominee in 15; although eleven of these have come in the past 14 elections. Despite North Carolina voting red in most elections since 1968, it has often been seen as a battleground state, with the four most recent popular votes split by fewer than four points. In the 2020 election, North Carolina was on of the closest results nationwide, with Donald Trump winning the popular vote by a one percent margin. North Carolinians in officeTwo U.S. presidents were born in North Carolina; the first was James K. Polk, who spent the first seven years of his life in the Waxhaws region, and the second was Andrew Johnson, who was born and raised in Raleigh. Coincidentally, both these men would move to Tennessee, where they would establish political careers before ascending to the presidency. Polk also failed to win the election in his state of birth, while Johnson's election (as Abraham Lincoln's vice presidential nominee) was not contested there. Electoral votes Between 1812 and 1840, North Carolina had 15 electoral votes, however this then decreased to just nine votes by the Reconstruction era, as higher net migration rates in other states saw the saw North Carolina's population grow more slowly than the national average. The allocation then rose to 13 votes in the 1930s, and remained at 13 or 14 until 2004, when it then returned to 15. Historically, the majority of North Carolinians have lived in rural areas, although recent decades have seen the population shift to be come more urban or suburban, and grow due to an influx of migrants from Latin America and South or Southeast Asia. In the 2024 election, North Carolina is expected to gain another electoral vote as its population grows faster than the national average, and higher birth rates among urban and foreign-born populations is likely to increase the Democratic Party's voter base in the state. 
 The statistic represents global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions between 1975 and 2019. Globally, 17.78 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide was emitted in relation to energy in 1980. Energy-related emissions stabilized in 2019 when emissions reached 33.3 billion metric tons, following two consecutive years of increases in greenhouse gas emissions. Global carbon dioxide emissions â€?additional informationIn 2016, carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion totaled some 32.3 billion metric tons. The volume of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions has steadily risen over the last decade, from 28.7 billion metric tons in 2009 to 33.3 billion metric tons in 2019. However, the rate of increase has slowed down in the last few years, but has still reached a historic high in the last year. From 2013 to 2016, there had been evidence of a global decoupling of greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth. It has been suggested that the immense addition of new renewable energy capacity has been critical for reducing emissions growth. In the recent past, a decrease or relatively unchanged volume of emissions has only been seen during economically weak periods, such as during the 2009 recession. Both the United States and China, two of the largest emitters in the world, registered a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions in 2015. In China, a reduction in coal consumption has enabled an economic restructuring towards less energy-intensive industries and an emphasis on renewable resources. However, the decrease in emissions from these two countries was largely offset by other developing Asian countries and the Middle East, as well as increased emissions in Europe. Carbon dioxide emissions worldwide were primarily emitted by the Asia Pacific region, which reported more emissions in 2018 than North America (6.04 billion metric tons) and Europe (4.21 billion metric tons) combined.

In that year, with direct commercial lines insurance premiums written amounting to 12.6 billion U.S. dollars, Zurich Insurance Group had a market share of 3.7 percent. Insurance and commercial lines insurance The general definition of insurance is the transfer of a risk of a loss that could be incurred from one entity to another entity in exchange for payment. In the face of uncertain loss, insurance manages risk, ensuring some degree of financial security should an unforeseen event result in loss. The institution or individual that purchases the insurance from the company that offers it is known as the â€˜insuredâ€?or the â€˜policy holderâ€? The amount of money charged to the insured is known as the premium. The premium is determined by the level of risk that is posed. If a catastrophic event such as a natural disaster was to occur and the insured suffered, as a result the insurer would have to pay out. In order that risk may be shared between companies, reinsurers often purchase insurance from the insurance company. This displacement of risk reduces expose and allows the insurer to take on more risk from other clients as a result. Commercial lines insurance are insurance products designed for and bought by businesses. The major forms of coverage include machinery, general liability, fire, business interruption, product liability and workers compensation among many others. Most of the different forms of coverage can be purchased separately, with the exception of business interruption which must be purchased as part of the fire insurance policy.

In a ranking of debt to GDP per country, Greece is currently ranked second. Greece's struggle after the financial crisis Greece is a developed country in the EU and is highly dependent on its service sector as well as its tourism sector in order to gain profits. After going through a large economic boom from the 1950s to the 1970s as well as somewhat high GDP growth in the early to mid 2000s, Greeceâ€™s economy took a turn for the worse and struggled intensively, primarily due to the Great Recession, the Euro crisis as well as its own debt crisis. National debt within the country saw significant gains over the past decades, however roughly came to a halt due to financial rescue packages issued from the European Union in order to help Greece maintain and improve their economical situation. The nationâ€™s continuous rise in debt has overwhelmed its estimated GDP over the years, which can be attributed to poor government execution and unnecessary spending. Large sums of financial aid were taken from major European banks to help balance out these government-induced failures and to potentially help refuel the economy to encourage more spending, which in turn would decrease the countryâ€™s continuously rising unemployment rate. Investors, consumers and workers alike are struggling to see a bright future in Greece, whose chances of an economic comeback are much lower than that of other struggling countries such as Portugal and Italy. However, Greece's financial situation might improve in the future, as it is estimated that at least its national debt will decrease - slowly, but steadily. Still, since its future participation in the European Union is in limbo as of now, these figures can only be estimates, not predictions.

See figures on India's economic growth here. For comparison, per capita GDP in China had reached about 6,995.25 U.S. dollars in 2013. India's economic progress Indiaâ€™s progress as a country over the past decade can be attributed to a global dependency on cheaper production of goods and services from developed countries around the world. Indiaâ€™s economy is built upon its agriculture, manufacturing and services sector, which, along with its drastic rise in population and demand for employment, led to a significant increase of the nationâ€™s GDP per capita. Despite experiencing rather momentous economic gains since the mid 2000s, the Indian economy stagnated around 2012, with a decrease in general growth as well as the value of its currency. Residents and consumers in India have recently shown pessimism regarding the future of the Indian economy as well as their own financial situation, and with the recent economic standstill, consumer confidence in the country could potentially lower in the near future. Typical Indian exports consist of agricultural products, jewelry, chemicals and ores. Imports consist primarily of crude oil, gold and precious stones, used primarily in the manufacturing of jewelry. As a result, India has seen a rather highly increased demand of several gems in order to boost their jewelry industry and in general their exports. Although India does not export an extensive amount of goods, especially when considering the stature of the country, India has remained as one of the worldâ€™s largest exporters.

Almost 30 thousand television ads in support of his candidacy were funded by super PAC money, the most of any other presidential hopeful. Super PACs are controversial because they are not the type of committee raising 50 dollar pledges, but rather millions of U.S. dollars from powerful and wealthy families and interest groups, which in turn can be suspected of wanting to influence their supported candidatesâ€?views. According to the New York Times, generous donations to super PACs in 2015-2016 have come from such figures as billionaire philanthropist and investor George Soros, who pledged 7 billion U.S. dollars to Hillary Clinton or C.V. Starr & Company Inc., a company run by former CEO of the A.I.G insurance company Maurice R. Greenberg, who donated 1o million U.S. dollars to Jeb Bush. As opposed to 2012, when business magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam made the largest donation, in the 2016 election Donald Trump himself has made the largest contribution, almost 13 million U.S. dollars, naturally to his own campaign.

 Medicaid and the Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provide medical coverage to millions of Americans, and one of the main criteria to determine eligibility is income. In states with expanded coverage, the minimum eligibility threshold for adults is 138 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). The impact of the Affordable Care Act The Affordable Care Act (ACA) created the opportunity for states to expand Medicaid to cover nearly all low-income adults. Most states chose to extend coverage, meaning adults are eligible if their household income is at or below 138 percent of the FPL. Before the ACA, applicants had to fit into one of several categories in order to be eligible. Each group had its own income rules, and they all differed from state to state. Most low-income adults without children were not eligible. Medicaid income rules simplified The ACA established a new methodology to determine income eligibility that helped to align rules that previously varied nationwide. In general, an individualâ€™s eligibility is now determined by their Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and where it falls in relation to the FPL. In 2020, the FPL for a one-person household was set at 12,760 U.S. dollars, which was the minimum income a person had to earn to qualify for Medicaid. In expansion states, an individual would still be eligible if they earned up to 138 percent of that figure.

 It is projected that the residential electricity price in the United States will increase by 2.8 percent between 2020 and 2021. Generally, retail electricity prices in the country have risen over the last decade. This trend is likely to continue as natural gas prices will likely also increase, raising electricity rates. As the natural gas supply is exposed to international markets that pay a higher rate, U.S. prices are also expected to rise despite a decrease in recent years that came as a result of the hydraulic fracturing boom. States with the highest and lowest electricity prices The price of electricity is partially dependent on the various energy sources, such as coal, gas, oil, as well as renewable or nuclear sources, used to generate power. Hawaii has one of the highest electricity prices at 30.78 U.S. cents per kilowatt hour due to the high costs of crude oil used to fuel the stateâ€™s electricity.

Interestingly, Russia is among the leading export countries worldwide and agricultural products, as well as meat, are among the main exported goods. Russiaâ€™s economy also profits significantly from selling and exporting fish and sea food. Due to large oil resources, Russia is also among the largest economies and the countries with the largest gross domestic product / GDP worldwide. Subsequently, living and working conditions in Russia should be above average, but for a long time, many Russians have struggled to get by.

This means that house prices in Canada outpaced Canadian incomes by 22.3 percent. It also shows that house prices grew faster than incomes in most of the countries. Portugal, the Netherlands and Ireland were the next most unaffordable countries.

This is likely due to the cooling of the housing market since 2018 due to the recently introduced mortgage stress test, the foreign buyers tax in British Columbia and higher interest rates. Average house prices in Canada are forecast to drop over the next few years. This should increase housing affordability in the country too, so Canadaâ€™s house price to income ratio should fall as a result.

It is dull grey in appearance and metallic in luster. It conducts electricity easily because there are electrons between the layers of carbon atoms. Under high pressures and temperatures, graphite turns into diamonds. This process is actually how synthetic diamonds are produced. Due to its high conductivity, graphite is used in electrodes, batteries, and solar panels. Some other uses include being used in pencils (as it is well known as â€˜pencil leadâ€?, and lubricants. Graphite was first used during the Neolithic Age as a paint. Since it was discovered in England around the year 1565, the use of graphite has increased.

Many in the media speculated that this was to prevent him from being classified as obese according to his body mass index. A number of photos also circulated on social media showing Trump next to (and visibly shorter than) a number of athletes who are officially 6'3", while photos of him standing next to Barack Obama were used to show that he may be closer to his predecessor's height, at 6'1". Nonetheless, Trump's medical report from June 3. 2020, shows that his official height remains at 6'3".

 The statistic shows the numbers of earthquakes worldwide from 2000 to 2019. In 2019, a total of 1,637 earthquakes with magnitude of five or more were recorded worldwide. Additional information on the effects of earthquakes While the technology used to find the source of and record earthquakes has improved since the 20th century, the ability of scientists to predict earthquakes is still severely limited. As earthquakes happen numerous times every day, the issue for policy makers and city planners isn't if an earthquake will occur, but how powerful it will be. Large earthquakes generally result in higher death tolls in developing countries or countries where building codes are less stringent. China has suffered from a number of strong earthquakes that have resulted in extremely high death tolls. While earthquakes occur around the globe along the various tectonic plate boundaries, a significant proportion occur around the basin of the Pacific Ocean in what is referred to as the Ring of Fire due to the high degree of tectonic activity. Many of the countries in the Ring of Fire, including Japan, Chile, the United States and New Zealand, led the way in earthquake policy and science as a result. The tragic loss of life is not the only major negative effect of earthquakes, a number of earthquakes have caused billions of dollars worth of damage to infrastructure and private property. The high cost of damage in the 2011 Fukushima and Christchurch earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand respectively demonstrates that even wealthy, developed countries who are experienced in dealing with earthquakes are ill-equipped when the large earthquakes hit.

 The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years. In Germany in 1800, the average woman of childbearing age would have 5.4 children over the course of their lifetime. It remained around this number until the late 1820s, when it then dropped to just under five, which was a long-term effect of the Napoleonic Period in Europe. From this point until the end of the nineteenth century, Germany's fertility rate was rather sporadic, reaching it's lowest point in 1855 with an average of 4.6 births per woman, and it's highest point in 1875 (just after the foundation of the German Empire in 1871), with an average of 5.4 live births per woman. From the beginning of the twentieth century until the end of the Second World War, Germany's fertility rate dropped from around 5 children per woman in 1900, to 1.9 in 1945. The only time where the fertility rate increased was in the inter-war years. Like other countries heavily involved in the Second World War, Germany (both East and West) experienced a Baby Boom from the late 1940s to the late 1960s, however it then dropped to it's lowest point of just 1.3 children per woman by 1995, shortly after the re-unification of Germany. In recent years, Germany's fertility rate has gradually been increasing again, and is expected to reach 1.6 in 2020, its highest rate in over forty years.

 In November 2020, the unadjusted unemployment rate of women in the United States stood at 6.1 percent. This was a slight decrease from the previous month, when it stood at 6.5 percent. What is seasonal adjustment? Seasonal adjustment is a statistical method that attempts to remove seasonal patters from figures to show how employment and unemployment changes from month to month. For example, seasonal adjustment is used to account for the extra people that are hired in retail around Christmas. Seasonal adjustment makes it so that monthly data can be compared more accurately over the long term. When looking at the seasonally adjusted female unemployment rate, for example, one can see that it is slightly higher than the unadjusted rate in order to account for the seasonal component.

Bangladesh and India dismantled more than 50 percent of the total number of ocean-going commercial vessels in 2019. Most of the ship scrapping activity is carried out in countries where the labor market and environmental regulations are weak. Impact of COVID on ship scrapping The economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic deeply impacted the global economy, leading to the worst decline in industrial production over the recent century. This had severe implications for all industries across the globe at varying degrees. Since the end of 2019, global ship demolition activity has increased sharply as a consequence of higher fuel prices and adverse market conditions. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the monthly demolition activity peaked at 2.3 million deadweight tons in February 2020. This trend is expected to continue throughout 2020, as owners face the increased underutilization of vessels brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides, as a result of strict lockdown measures across the globe, the impact of the COVID-19 crisis persists. Over 12 million deadweight tons of commercial fleet were delivered in January 2020, which declined to roughly 5.9 million deadweight tons by March 2020. Although some countries have started to make progress in normalizing economic and social activity again, the recovery to previous levels could take longer than expected.

 Of all the major battles of the American Civil War, the Battle of Stones River had the highest percentage of casualties. Approximately 76 thousand men took part in the battle, with just under one third becoming casualties. The battle itself took place at the turn of 1862-1863, and began on the morning of December 31, when both the Union army of Major General William S. Rosecrans, and the Confederate army of General Braxton Bragg, planned to attack one another, with Bragg launching his attack first and catching the Union army by surprise (much like at the Battle of Shiloh). A strong defense, quickly mounted by Brigadier General Philip Sheridan, was able to prevent a total catastrophe, and the Union were then able to establish a defensive line which held out through repeated attacks from Bragg's men.

With help from Walkerâ€™s two brothers, both of whom are similar in appearance to their late brother, Weta was able to fashion digital models of Walkerâ€™s face. They then combined this with actual footage of the actor to form a likeness to superimpose over other actorsâ€?bodies. Aside from â€˜The Fast and the Furiousâ€?movies, Paul Walker also starred in 2001 horror movie â€˜Joy Rideâ€?(also known as â€˜Roadkillâ€?outside the U.S.), 2008 thriller â€˜The Lazarus Projectâ€? and â€˜Eight Belowâ€? a survival drama movie based on 1983 Japanese production â€˜Antarcticaâ€?

 The Battle of Gettysburg, at the beginning of July 1963, was the largest and costliest battle of the American Civil War, and is often regarded as the turning point in the war. Confederate General Robert E. Lee sought to capitalize on his victories earlier in the year, such as the Battle of Chancellorsville, by launching his second invasion of the northern states. He did this in order to alleviate the pressure on the Virginia farmland, which had been ravaged by the preceding campaigns, and also in an attempt to force the Union into negotiations to end the war. In June, General Lee's forces marched through Virginia, into Pennsylvania, and were pursued by Union forces led by Major General Joseph Hooker, and later Maj. Gen. George G. Meade. The Battle of Gettysburg The armies met near the town of Gettysburg, PA, on the morning of July 1. In the first day of fighting the Confederacy won control of much of the area surrounding the town, while the Union held the lands to the south. On the second day reinforcements, arrived on both sides, and while the Confederate forces tried flanking the entrenched and heavily defended Union forces, they had limited success. At 1pm on the third day of battle, General Lee launched what was probably the largest artillery bombardment of the entire war, and two hours later he launched Pickett's Charge, which saw roughly 12.5 thousand Confederate troops charge the Union forces entrenched on Cemetery Ridge. The bombardment had little effect on the Union defences, and the oncoming soldiers suffered heavy casualties before being forced to retreat, marking an end to the battle and a victory for the Union. Gettysburg has been described as the bloodiest battle of the war, as, not only were the casualties higher than any other battle, but the depletion of ammunition stocks led to much close-quarters and hand-to-hand combat on the final day. Legacy Over 165 thousand men took part in the Battle of Gettysburg, with roughly one third becoming casualties. More than seven thousand men died in the fighting, and a further 33 thousand were wounded. The battle also saw the deaths of six Confederate and five Union generals, more than any other battle in the war. Although the war would not end for another two years, this battle is seen by many as the turning point in the war, and as the closest that the Confederacy came to accomplishing their goal of complete cessation from the Union. Prior to this the Confederacy had won more decisive battles than the Union, but after Gettysburg this shifted in favor of the Union, who would go on to win the war in 1865. Four months after the battle, President Lincoln gave his famous Gettysburg Address, which paid tribute to the men who fell in the battle, and has gone on to become one of the most famous speeches in American history.

In that year, the United States was the largest uranium consumer worldwide, using a total of almost 19,160 metric tons of uranium. Uranium consumption worldwide Uranium is a heavy metal that occurs in many rocks as well as in sea water. Its high density allows it to be used in the keels of yachts as well as for radiation shielding. However, it is most commonly known for its use as a source of concentrated energy in nuclear power plants. Under specialized nuclear reactors, various radioisotopes of uranium can be produced to use in medicine, food preservation, and industrial agriculture. For example, radioactive chemical tracers can be used in the diagnosis of the human body. Uranium is generally extracted through open-pit and underground mines, however, with advances in technology, alternative methods such as in-situ leach mining have become more prominent. Uranium consumption is the highest in the United States, France, and China, as of 2018. However, Kazakhstan and Canada are among the top producers of uranium with around 21,700 metric tons and 7,000 metric tons produced in 2018, respectively. In fact, the United States receives much of its uranium from Canada. Australia has some of the largest known recoverable uranium resources in the world with some 1.27 million metric tons as of 2018.

 Bulgaria, with the help of the Russian Empire, achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878. In the decades before independence, Bulgaria's population had remained between 2.2 and 2.8 million people, and growth was much slower then the following century. Although most at the time assumed that it would become a Russian ally, Bulgaria defied the expectations and aligned itself with the western powers, and developed into a modern European state by the turn in the late 1800s. Bulgaria at war In the early twentieth century Bulgaria was involved in both World Wars, as well as two Balkan Wars. The Balkan states were unhappy with the borders assigned to them by the western powers, and instead wanted to re-draw them based on the dispersal of ethnic groups. This led to the first Balkan War in 1912, which saw Bulgaria fight alongside Greece and Serbia against the Ottomans. Bulgaria fought the second Balkan War on all sides, this time against Greece, Serbia, Romania and the Ottomans, as the dispute over borders continued. Bulgaria was defeated this time, and sustained heavy casualties, amassing in 58 thousand fatalities and over 100 thousand wounded in the two wars. In the First World War, Bulgaria remained neutral at first, in order to recover from the previous wars, but then aligned itself with the Central powers in 1915, and played a vital role in maintaining their control in the Balkans. While Bulgaria was initially successful, its allies weakened as the war progressed, and then Bulgaria eventually succumbed to Allied forces and surrendered in 1918, with almost 200 thousand Bulgarians dying as a result of the war. The interwar years was a period of political and economic turmoil, and when control was re-established, Bulgaria was then able to maintain it's neutrality throughout most of the Second World War, (although there was some conflict and bombings in certain areas). Rise and fall of communism After the war, Bulgaria became a communist state, and life became harsh for the civil population there until the late 1950s when the standard of living rose again. In the late 1980s, like many Eastern European countries, Bulgaria experienced economic decline as the communist system began to collapse. Political failures also contributed to this, and approximately 300 thousand Bulgarian Turks migrated to Turkey, greatly weakening the agricultural economy. This trend of mass migration abroad continued after the fall of the iron curtain, as well as the rise of unemployment. Bulgaria reached it's peak population size in 1985 at 8.98 million inhabitants, but then the number decreases each year, and is expected to be 6.94 million in 2020. This drop in population size has been attributed to the economic collapse at the end of communism in Eastern Europe, causing many to leave the country in search of work elsewhere. Bulgaria also has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, with 8.7 births per 1,000 people per year (in 2018).

 Inflation in Zimbabwe rose to 10.6 percent in 2018, and is projected to jump dramatically to 319.04 percent in 2020. After that, estimates predict a 3.7 percent equilibrium for now - however, given Zimbabweâ€™s history of poor monetary policy, including one of the worst instances of hyperinflation, this seems unrealistic. Inflation history Inflation depends significantly on economic expectations of it, making it hard to reduce inflation once it has hit higher levels. This happened in Zimbabwe in the years approaching 2008, at the end of which a single U.S. dollar was worth over 2.6 trillion Zimbabwe dollars, up from 10,000 Zimbabwe dollars at the start of 2005. This all but destroyed Zimbabweâ€™s economy, leading to very low gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and a government struggling to finance itself. The way ahead In 2009, the Zimbabwean dollar had twelve zeros slashed from the banknotes. This was not enough, and after three decades of rule, former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe was removed from power at the end of 2017. Citizens of the country are trying to hold foreign banknotes; they prefer U.S. dollars or euros, but the South African rand is more common. However, the randâ€™s performance against other currencies has been lackluster in recent years. This underscores the struggle that the Zimbabwean people have to find a stable currency at the moment.

However, the median income of black households is even lower than Hispanic households. Income inequality is problem without an easy solution in the United States, especially since ethnicity is a contributing factor. Systemic racism contributes to the non-White population suffering from income inequality, which causes the opportunity for growth to stagnate.

 Depending on the reach and level of vaccination within Europe's various states in the 1870s, smallpox had a varied impact on various age groups. For infants below the age of one year, smallpox was responsible for between 15 and 30 percent of all deaths in the given regions, as many of these babies had not yet been vaccinated and were at a high risk of succumbing to the virus. In states where the vaccination of infants was not compulsory, such as the Netherlands, Berlin (Prussia) and Leipzig (Saxony), the share of deaths due to smallpox among young children remained high, while it was relatively low in Hesse and Scotland, who had introduced mandatory vaccination in 1815 and 1864 respectively. Great Pandemic highlights the need for revaccination As Hesse had been vaccinating on a large scale for generations, the share of smallpox deaths was relatively low among young people; however, between 1870 and 1872, over half of all deaths among those aged 30 to 60 years were due to smallpox. The reason for this was because smallpox vaccination in infancy did not guarantee lifelong protection, therefore immunity often wore off in adulthood. In the 1830s and 1840s, several German armies started to vaccinate new recruits regardless of whether they had been vaccinated in infancy or not; when scientists compared the smallpox death rates in the army with that of the civilian population during this pandemic, they noticed that it was much lower in the army, due to these revaccination policies. This discovery helped many scientists in Europe recognize the need for revaccination, which greatly contributed to the eradication of the disease across most of Europe in the early twentieth century.

Since then, however, coronavirus cases have escalated. In September 2020, confirmed cases have even surpassed April figures. Age and gender disparities According to confirmed figures only, infections, hospital admissions, and deaths varied in terms of age. In the Netherlands, a higher number of positive tests were found in younger age groups, whereas most hospital patients were aged 60 to 84 years old and most deaths occurred in people aged over 80 years old. From a gender perspective, the coronavirus infected more women than men in the country. However, hospitalizations and deaths were higher in the Dutch male population. In other words, Dutch figures seem to indicate that COVID-19 infected more women yet had more negative consequences for men. Nonetheless, these facts rely solely on confirmed cases that depend on national testing capacities and policies.

Between 2003 and 2012, attendance at performing art events steadily declined in the U.S., reaching its lowest point in 2012 with 74.94 million attendees. The decline in attendance can be attributed to varying factors. A 2012 survey into the barriers of attending visual and performing art events found that 38.3 percent of respondents felt art events cost too much. Similarly, a separate 2014 survey conducted by LaPlaca Cohen found that the main economic reason for decreasing cultural participation was people reducing their expenses across the board. Despite the decrease in public participation in the arts, the number of people studying within the field has increased. Between 1999 and 2012, the number of students receiving a visual or performing arts bachelors degree in the U.S. increased from 54,505 to 95,797.

While in 1958, only 4 percent stated they approved of intermarriages, 87 percent said the same in 2013. The growing acceptance of interracial marriages The remarkable change in approval of interracial marriage amongst Americans displays an ongoing trend of public acceptance of lifestyles that were once disapproved of. The once frowned-upon concept of interracial relationships has correspondingly changed with the evolution of American culture as well as new generations. Interracial relationships were often a topic of debate, however, these debates have since become less conservative, with many citing the positivity of racially mixed marriages for the development of society. The United States, despite its history, has become an openly diverse country, with a multitude of immigrants becoming legal U.S. citizens and gaining rights, most notably from Asia. Based on a recent survey in 2010, it was evident that interracial marriages in the United States were primarily present with Hispanics and Asians. The change in the opinion of U.S. citizens regarding interracial marriage is obvious within the different generations, whether it is the older or the younger; however the concept is most definitely easier accepted within the latter, something that is most evidently seen within pop culture and sports.

Home construction expenditure has been steadily increasing since 2011. This trend is set to continue through 2022, which indicates that the revenues earned by home construction companies, such as D.R. Horton, will also continue to increase. New home sales follow the same trend Unsurprisingly, the number of new houses sold follows the same pattern. The property crash of 2008, which was a leading factor in the global financial crisis at that time, impacted residential property sales in the United States. However, this market has also recovered since then and has been on the rise since 2011. The number of homes started began to increase from 2009 onwards, but the increase in home sales didnâ€™t commence until two years later. This time lag is logical, as buyers often lack confidence in the property market after such a catastrophic incident as a property crash.

 In 2019, the unemployment rate in urban areas of China ranged at about 3.6 percent. According to IMF projections, the unemployment rate will increase to 3.8 percent in 2020 due to the impact of the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic and drop again to 3.6 percent in 2021. Unemployment rate in China From the statistic at hand one can see that the unemployment rate in China has been fairly constant at around four percent over the last few years. This may be partly explained by the fact that due to its socialist heritage, full employment policy historically has played a major role in economic considerations of the Chinese government. Another possible explanation may be found in the indexâ€™s methodology, which, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, gathers only employment data for urban regions. The debate as to whether to adjust the methodology accordingly in order to create a more accurate statistical image is still ongoing among Chinese politicians and statisticians. A main concern in Chinaâ€™s current state of employment lies within the large regional differences. As of 2018, the unemployment rate in northeastern regions of China was notably higher than in Chinaâ€™s southern parts. In Beijing, Chinaâ€™s political and cultural center, unemployment ranged at merely 1.4 percent for 2018.

Quarterly growth data published by the National Bureau of Statistics indicated 4.9 percent GDP growth for the third quarter of 2020. 
 In 2019, IBMâ€™s global technology services segment generated over 27 billion U.S. dollars of the companyâ€™s revenue, which for 2019 stood at around 77 billion U.S. dollars. In 2016, IBM first changed its segment reporting to reflect the companyâ€™s shift away from being a hardware, software and services company, and towards becoming a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company.

For example, the company created a cognitive solutions business, the segment where initiatives such as Watson, Watson health, Watson IoT, and transaction processing software are held. Merging multiple segments into one helped highlight their mutual importance to each other: linking Integration Software with Cloud Infrastructure and Platform, for example, reflected the importance of integration software to enterprise-grade hybrid clouds. These changes were made to provide investors with additional transparency on the direction of IBMâ€™s business.

The United States has performed the most tests worldwide but underwent some early problems. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued the recall of the first test kits after faults were discovered. The silent spread of the coronavirus Widespread testing will also help to detect the hundreds of thousands of people who might be asymptomatic â€?showing few or no symptoms of the illness. These carriers are unwittingly transmitting the virus to others, and the threat of silent transmission is one reason why mass lockdowns have been imposed around the world. However, as asymptomatic carriers produce no symptoms, they may have developed some natural immunity to the illness. Viruses are not as easily spread in communities with high rates of immunity, which helps to protect more vulnerable groups of people. When an infection rate is less than one, a community has achieved herd immunity.

 The 1860 election cemented the Republican Party's position as one of the two major parties in U.S. politics, along with the already-established Democratic Party. Since this time, all U.S. presidents have been affiliated with these two parties, and their candidates have generally performed the best in each presidential election. In spite of this two-party dominance, there have always been third-party or independent candidates running on the ballot, either on a nationwide, regional or state level. No third-party candidate has ever won a U.S. election, although there have been several occasions where they have carried states or split the vote with major party candidates. Today, the largest third-party in U.S. politics is the Libertarian Party, who are considered to be socially liberal, but economically conservative; in the 2016 election, their nominee, Gary Johnson, secured just over three percent of the popular vote, while their latest candidate, Jo Jorgenson, is thought to have received just over one percent of the vote in the 2020 election. Theodore Roosevelt The most successful third-party nominee was Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election, who was the only third-party candidate to come second in a U.S. election. The former president had become disillusioned with his successor's growing conservatism, and challenged the incumbent President Taft for the Republican nomination in 1912. Roosevelt proved to be the most popular candidate in the primaries, however Taft had already secured enough Republican delegates in the south to seal the nomination. Roosevelt then used this split in the Republican Party to form his own, Progressive Party, and challenged both major party candidates for the presidency (even taking a bullet in the process). In the end, Roosevelt carried six states, and won over 27 percent of the popular vote, while Taft carried just two states with 23 percent of the vote; this split in the Republican Party allowed the Democratic nominee, Woodrow Wilson, to win 82 percent of the electoral votes despite only winning 42 percent of the popular vote. Other notable performances The last third-party candidate to win electoral votes was George Wallace* in the 1968 election. The Democratic Party had been the most popular party in the south since before the Civil War, however their increasingly progressive policies in the civil rights era alienated many of their southern voters. Wallace ran on a white supremacist and pro-segregationist platform and won the popular vote in five states. This was a similar story to that of Storm Thurmond, twenty years earlier. In the 1992 election, Independent candidate Ross Perot received almost one fifth of the popular vote. Although he did not win any electoral votes, Perot split the vote so much that he prevented either Clinton or Bush Sr. from winning a majority in any state except Arkansas (Clinton's home state). Perot ran again in 1996, but with less than half the share of votes he received four years previously; subsequent studies and polls have shown that Perot took an equal number of votes from both of the major party candidates in each election.

As of March 2017, the highest earnings were those of an American professional gamer, Saahil Arora, better known among his peers as "UNiVeRsE". He started his adventure with eSports as part of a team Evil Geniuses in 2012 playing DOTA 2, but truly kicked-off his career as an offlaner in team Dignitas during the International 3 in 2013. Later in the year he agreed to a contract buyout settlement which allowed him to rejoin Evil Geniuses. Throughout his recorded gaming career, UNiVeRsE has earned 2.72 million U.S. dollars. Among female players, the profits are significantly smaller. To date, the highest earning woman in eSports, Sasha Hostyn from Canada, who goes by "Scarlett" in the gaming industry, has made 171 thousand U.S. dollars in the course of her eSports career. Hostyn began her professional eSports journey with StarCraft II in 2012 and her skills were awarded with nicknames such as "the queen of StarCraft II".

Belgium has multiple online news outlets Belgium has two main languages: Flemish (or Belgian Dutch) in the northern region of Flanders and French in Wallonia in the south and (parts of) the Brussels Capital-Region (the city of Brussels and its surrounding villages). This leads to large differences in online media consumption in the country. When it comes to Flemish brands, the website of the newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws was used the most frequently on a weekly basis. RTL News was the most popular online news outlet in the French parts of Belgium. Dutch online news consumption In the Netherlands, NU.nl was the most used online news brand in 2018: 46 percent of the respondents indicating they used this website.

 Prior to 1829, the area of modern day Greece was largely under the control of the Ottoman Empire. In 1821, the Greeks declared their independence from the Ottomans, and achieved it within 8 years through the Greek War of Independence. The Independent Kingdom of Greece was established in 1829 and made up the southern half of present-day, mainland Greece, along with some Mediterranean islands. Over the next century, Greece's borders would expand and readjust drastically, through a number of conflicts and diplomatic agreements; therefore the population of Greece within those political borders** was much lower than the population in what would be today's borders. As there were large communities of ethnic Greeks living in neighboring countries during this time, particularly in Turkey, and the data presented here does not show the full extent of the First World War, Spanish Flu Pandemic and Greko-Turkish War on these Greek populations. While it is difficult to separate the fatalities from each of these events, it is estimated that between 500,000 and 900,000 ethnic Greeks died at the hands of the Ottomans between the years 1914 and 1923, and approximately 150,000 died due to the 1918 flu pandemic. These years also saw the exchange of up to one million Orthodox Christians from Turkey to Greece, and several hundred thousand Muslims from Greece to Turkey; this exchange is one reason why Greece's total population did not change drastically, despite the genocide, displacement and demographic upheaval of the 1910s and 1920s. Greece in WWII A new Hellenic Republic was established in 1924, which saw a decade of peace and modernization in Greece, however this was short lived. The Greek monarchy was reintroduced in 1935, and the prime minister, Ioannis Metaxas, headed a totalitarian government that remained in place until the Second World War. Metaxas tried to maintain Greek neutrality as the war began, however Italy's invasion of the Balkans made this impossible, and the Italian army tried invading Greece via Albania in 1940. The outnumbered and lesser-equipped Greek forces were able to hold off the Italian invasion and then push them backwards into Albania, marking the first Allied victory in the war. Following a series of Italian failures, Greece was eventually overrun when Hitler launched a German and Bulgarian invasion in April 1941, taking Athens within three weeks. Germany's involvement in Greece meant that Hitler's planned invasion of the Soviet Union was delayed, and Hitler cited this as the reason for it's failure (although most historians disagree with this). Over the course of the war approximately eight to eleven percent of the Greek population died due to fighting, extermination, starvation and disease; including over eighty percent of Greece's Jewish population in the Holocaust. Following the liberation of Greece in 1944, the country was then plunged into a civil war (the first major conflict of the Cold War), which lasted until 1949, and saw the British and American-supported government fight with Greek communists for control of the country. The government eventually defeated the Soviet-supported communist forces, and established American influence in the Aegean and Balkans throughout the Cold War. Post-war Greece From the 1950s until the 1970s, the Marshall Plan, industrialization and an emerging Tourism sector helped the Greek economy to boom, with one of the strongest growth rates in the world. Apart from the military coup, which ruled from 1967 to 1974, Greece remained relatively peaceful, prosperous and stable throughout the second half of the twentieth century. The population reached 11.2 million in the early 2000s, before going into decline for the past fifteen years. This decline came about due to a negative net migration rate and slowing birth rate, ultimately facilitated by the global financial crisis of 2007 and 2008; many Greeks left the country in search of work elsewhere, and the economic troubles have impacted the financial incentives that were previously available for families with many children. While the financial crisis was a global event, Greece was arguably the hardest-hit nation during the crisis, and suffered the longest recession of any advanced economy. The financial crisis has had a consequential impact on the Greek population, which has dropped by 800,000 in 15 years, and the average age has increased significantly, as thousands of young people migrate in search of employment.

 This statistic shows the degree of urbanization in Germany from 2009 to 2019. Urbanization means the share of urban population in the total population of a country. In 2019, 77.38 percent of Germany's total population lived in urban areas and cities. Urbanization in Germany Currently, about three quarter of the German population live in urban areas and cities, which is more than in most nations around the world. Urbanization, as it can be seen in this graph, refers to the number of people living in an urban area and has nothing to do with the actual geographical size or footprint of an area or country. A country which is significantly bigger than Germany could have a similar degree of urbanization, just because not all areas in the country are inhabitable, for example. One example for this is Russia, where urbanization has reached comparable figures to Germany, even though its geographical size is significantly bigger. However, Germanyâ€™s level of urbanization does not make the list of the top 30 most urbanized nations in the world, where urbanization rates are higher than 83 percent. Also, while 25 percent of the population in Germany still lives in rural areas, rural livelihoods are not dependent on agriculture, as only 0.75 percent of GDP came from the agricultural sector in 2014. So while Germany's urbanization rate is growing, a significant percentage of the population is still living in rural areas. Furthermore, Germany has a number of shrinking cities which are located to the east and in older industrial regions around the country. Considering that population growth in Germany is on the decline, because of low fertility rates, and that a number of cities are shrinking, the urban population is likely shifting to bigger cities which have more economic opportunities than smaller ones.

 In 2019, Avengers: Endgame overtook 2009's Avatar as the highest grossing film of all time at the international Box Office. As of 2020, the difference between Endgame and Avatar's totals is fewer than ten million dollars, however this may change over the next few years as Avatar is likely to be shown again in theaters prior to midnight releases of it's four sequels (the first of which is due in 2022). Before Avatar, the record had been held by 1997's Titanic (both of which were directed by James Cameron). When adjusted for inflation, 1939's Gone With the Wind is the highest grossing film of all time, with some sources claiming that it has generated approximately 3.4 billion dollars in today's money***. The highest grossing film of 2020 was The Eight Hundred, which took over 460 million dollars worldwide; the first ever non-Hollywood production to feature on this list. The significant drop off in global revenues in 2020 was due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw the closure of thousands of movie theaters across the world; although the varying restrictions per country eventually saw Asian markets overtake North American and European markets as the largest worldwide, and five of the ten highest grossing films in 2020 were either Chinese or Japanese productions. Additionally, many major Hollywood releases have been delayed until 2021 or beyond, while a significant number of films had their theatrical release cancelled and were instead released via online streaming services; it remains to be seen what the long-term impact of the pandemic will be on the entertainment industry, or the extent of the economic damage caused to movie theaters around the world. Recurring figures Throughout the list, many of the same directors and actors appear in multiple films. Stephen Spielberg has directed more of these films than any other director, with six titles to his name. Cecil B. DeMille, a "founding father" of American Cinema, and Disney's Hamilton Luske, have each directed (or co-directed) five movies on this list. 2012's Frozen is the only film made by a female director; Jennifer Lee, and 2000's Mission: Impossible 2 is the only film made by a non-white director; John Woo. If we look to those in front of the camera, Harrison Ford, through his roles in the Star Wars and Indiana Jones films, has appeared in the highest number of films listed here; featuring in seven titles. His Star Wars co-star, Carrie Fisher, has appeared in five films listed here, more than any other actress. When looking at the companies behind the films featured on this list, we can see that Disney and Paramount Pictures (in all of their forms) have each produced and/or distributed 23 of the films on this list, at the time of their release. Disney dominates Since 1999, just three of the 22 highest grossing movies were not sequels or continuations of other franchises (although sequels for two of these films have subsequently been made or are in production), and seven of the ten most recent titles are Disney properties.

Population development in China As of mid 2018, China was the country with the largest population worldwide, closely followed by India, which ranked second with a population of about 1.37 billion people. As population growth in India is higher than in China, India will soon become the most populous country in the world. Due to several mechanisms put into place by the Chinese government as well as changing circumstances in the working and social environment of the Chinese people, population growth has subsided over the past decades, displaying an annual population growth rate of merely around 0.5 percent in recent years. Nevertheless, compared to the world population in total, China held a share of about 19 percent of the overall global population in 2010. China's aging population In terms of demographic developments, the birth control efforts of the Chinese government had considerable effects on the demographic pyramid in China. Upon closer examination of the age distribution, a clear trend of an aging population becomes visible. In order to curb the negative effects of an aging population, the Chinese government abolished the one-child policy in 2015, which had been in effect since 1979. However, many Chinese parents nowadays are reluctant to have a second or third child, as it is the case in most of the developed countries in the world. The number of births in China varied in the years following the abolishment of the one-child policy, but did not increase considerably. Among the reasons most prominent for parents not having more children are the rising living costs and costs for child care, growing work pressure, a growing trend towards self-realization and individualism, and changing social behaviors.

In 2019, the inflation rate in India was around 4.76 percent compared to the previous year. See figures on India's economic growth for additional information. India's inflation rate and economy Inflation is generally defined as the increase of prices of goods and services over a certain period of time, as opposed to deflation, which describes a decrease of these prices. Inflation is a significant economic indicator for a country. The inflation rate is the rate at which the general rise in the level of prices, goods and services in an economy occurs and how it affects the cost of living of those living in a particular country. It influences the interest rates paid on savings and mortgage rates but also has a bearing on levels of state pensions and benefits received. A 4 percent increase in the rate of inflation in 2011 for example would mean an individual would need to spend 4 percent more on the goods he was purchasing than he would have done in 2010. Indiaâ€™s inflation rate has been on the rise over the last decade. However, it has been decreasing slightly since 2010. Indiaâ€™s economy, however, has been doing quite well, with its GDP increasing steadily for years, and its national debt decreasing. The budget balance in relation to GDP is not looking too good, with the state deficit amounting to more than 9 percent of GDP.

Several foreign media sources, including New York Times and Financial Times, published articles suggesting that the official statistics on the COVID-19 death toll in Russia could be lowered. A narrow definition of a death from COVID-19 and a general increase in mortality in Moscow were pointed out while suggesting why actual death figures could be higher than reported. Russian explanation of lower COVID-19 deaths Experts and lawmakers from Russia provided several answers to the accusations. Among them were the fact that Russians timely reported symptoms to doctors, a high number of tests conducted, as well as a higher herd immunity of the population compared to other countries.

 In the American Civil War, Union and Confederate officers were paid very similarly until they reached the rank of Lieutenant, however Union allowances were generally higher than those of the Confederacy, which means that their wages would have been higher. The Union also paid their more highly ranked officers better than the Confederacy, with Generals receiving much more. For example, a Union colonel would receive the cash value of six human and three horse rations per day, amounting to an extra 78 dollars. It is also important to note that the Confederacy did have generous bonuses for their generals, such as time served, and whether they took an active role on the battlefield. For example, General Robert E. Lee would have officially received 301 dollars per month, but with bonuses he would have received 604 dollars. Payment methods At the outbreak of the American Civil War, the Confederate Army adopted the wage structure of the US Army before the civil war, whereas the Union created a new wage structure as their financial reserves allowed them to pay their soldiers more than the Confederacy. In both armies, soldiers were supposed to get paid every two months, but in reality, Union soldiers often went up to six or eight months without being paid, and for Confederate troops this could be even longer. The graph also shows only the wage paid to the soldiers and does not include officer allowances. Black men in the union army At the outbreak of the war, the question of whether to allow freed black men to serve in the army divided the Union leadership, until mid-1862 where the number of white men enlisting decreased. When the Union opened their ranks to black men, enlistment was initially slow, until prominent black figures such as Frederick Douglas encouraged it as he believed it would help them obtain full citizenship. Over the course of the war roughly two hundred thousand black men served in the Union Army and Navy, and many women (incl. Harriet Tubman) served as nurses and spies/scouts. Although they were allowed to serve, black soldiers were still discriminated against. While white privates were paid thirteen dollars per month, black soldiers were officially paid three dollars less, and black soldiers also had an additional three dollars automatically deducted from each wage to pay for their clothing. This discrepancy was resolved in 1864, and black men were paid the same as their white counterparts form this point onwards.

The most expensive is app installs, which means that advertisers need to pay 0.3 U.S. dollars per click that leads to customers installing apps, compared to 0.02 U.S. dollars for post engagement. Brand awareness, page likes, reach and conversions are in the middle of the spectrum. All in all, after a spike in advertising costs in third quarter of 2017, when Facebook CPCs grew by 282 percent year-on-year, the companyâ€™s ad rates were being increasingly lowered thanks to their improved targeting and growing engagement.

Icelandâ€™s economy took a big hit during the economic crisis of 2008, but has been showing increasing strength since then. When Icelandâ€™s banks were on the verge of collapse in 2008, the country - unlike the United States - did not come to the rescue, but let their banks fail. Icelandâ€™s recovery should be seen as no less than remarkable. In 2015, Iceland had reduced its inflation rate from 7.5 percent in 2010 to 1.6 percent and the unemployment rate dropped from 7.6 percent in 2010 to 4.0 percent in 2015. The GDP growth rate is strong at around 4 percent and the country is successfully reducing its national debt. Iceland had to borrow money to stay afloat during the crisis.

This allowed the country to keep wages the same and make Iceland more competitive on the world market. Countries such as Greece are not so lucky because they do not have the ability to use this economic parameter.

In the 2008 presidential elections, she was the first woman in the United States history to be nominated by a major party. At the time, Clinton, a Yale Law School graduate, already had extended experience in politics due to her eight years as a New York senator, between 2001 and 2009, as well as due to her role as a First Lady during the two terms as president of her husband, Bill Clinton, between 1993 and 2001. Although at first she was leading in opinion polls regarding the Democratic nomination, the platform of change on which Illinois senator Barak Obama was running quickly started gaining popularity among voters. Clinton placed third in the 2008 Iowa Democratic caucus, but defeated Obama in the New Hampshire primary. After a long battle in the following months, she eventually ended her campaign and endorsed Obama in June and went off to become a Secretary of State in his administration. Following Obamaâ€™s reelection in 2012, Clintonâ€™s candidacy was widely expected, prompting many media outlets to play a game of â€œwill she run or wonâ€™t she run?â€?although she had repeatedly denied making any official promises. As it turned out, she is running, as announced in a video message released in April 2015. Hillary Clintonâ€™s biggest rival in the race for the Democratic nomination is Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, whom she defeated in the February 1st Iowa caucus by a very small margin - 49.8 percent versus 49.6 percent of the votes. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who, prior to his stance in the United States Senate, has also been a member of the U.S. House of Representatives between 1991 and 2007, as well as mayor of Burlington, VT for an additional seven years.

 The statistic shows the largest insurance companies worldwide in 2018, by net premiums written. The net premiums written by U.S. health insurance company UnitedHealth Group amounted to approximately 178 billion U.S. dollars in 2018.Insurance and the economy Insurance is the transfer of risk from one entity to another in exchange for payment. It serves as a form of risk management, allowing a degree of financial security to policyholders in the face of uncertain loss. The insurance and the reinsurance industry are huge sectors; some of the worldâ€™s largest companies are insurance companies, but despite the status and the financial clout that comes with this, the insurance industry is heavily reliant on the state of the economy, which, at present, is not in the best of shape. Many economists, however, recognize the symbiotic relationship that exists between the two; insurance has the power to fuel growth. More than 300 billion US dollars are distributed by the insurance industry in the United States each year through policy benefits and claims. This money has a trickle down effect that can be felt in all areas of the economy. In addition to this, insurance companies also count as some of the largest investors out there; they invest in stocks and bond which helps to keep the financial markets ticking over. It is estimated that insurance companies have a stake of around a trillion US dollars in the United States economy alone. Insurance also has the ability to provide recovery in some sectors in particular. Insurance policies allow businesses to replace property lost, be they through fire or through major catastrophic events; it also allows homeowners to rebuild, in turn pushing the construction sector. In the general sense, businesses would be unable to carry out everyday transactions without insurance. Even when we consider the simplest of actions within a business, from the manufacture of products to hiring a new employee, insurance plays a role.

 This statistic shows the reported motor vehicle theft rate in Canada from 2000 to 2019. There were about 231.62 motor vehicle thefts per 100,000 residents in Canada in 2019. Motor Vehicle Theft Motor vehicle theft, a subset of property crime, is the theft or attempted theft of any self-propelled land vehicles such as cars, trucks, motorcycles and ATVs. Motor vehicles are typically stolen for resale and parts after being stripped down, or for joy rides, short term thefts for the sole purpose of entertainment. Motor vehicle theft has been on the decline for some years. It follows the downward trend of all property crime in Canada, which is down 40 percent since 2000. It is thought one of the primary reasons for the decline in motor vehicle thefts is better anti-theft technology in newer cars, such as engine immobilizers, which make it very difficult to steal without the ignition key. In fact, all of the vehicles on Insurance Bureau of Canadaâ€™s list of top ten most stolen automobiles predate legislation that went into effect in 2007 requiring new cars sold in Canada to be equipped with an engine immobilizer. Compared to 2000 rates, the 2019 rate of motor vehicle theft across Canada of 231.62 is 55 percent lower. The greatest number of thefts for the same year among the provinces occurred in Alberta at 16,572 total thefts. 
 This statistic shows the value of specialty chemical shipments in the United States from 1990 to 2019, broken down by type.

Specialty chemicals shipments In 2019, the value of chemical coatings shipments totaled 27.58 billion U.S. dollars, while other specialty chemical shipments totaled 68.01 billion U.S. dollars. Specialty chemicals include substances such as adhesives, cosmetic additives, fragrances, polymers, and surfactants. These materials are often sold based on their function or performance. The total value of U.S. specialty chemical shipments totaled 95.59 billion U.S. dollars in 2019. Specialty chemicals companies and producing regions BASF of Germany, and U.S. companies Dow and DuPont are considered some of the worldâ€™s leading chemical companies based on revenue. The companies generated 65.3 billion U.S. dollars, 41.75 billion U.S. dollars, and 21.3 billion U.S. dollars, respectively, in 2019. Specialty chemicals require constant innovation and knowledge to be successful. Due to the spread of technological advancements and rapid economic growth, the specialty chemical sector has began to shift towards the Middle East and Asia. China may no longer be considered a low-cost producer and the country has started to shift towards meeting domestic demands for higher value products. Environmental concerns about the chemical industry There are always environmental and human health concerns in regards to the shipping of chemicals and many governments have established guidelines and international conventions on how to properly transport and store chemicals. As of 2018, about 14 percent of industrial waste that was disposed on-site and on land in the U.S. was through the chemical industry.

 The pole vault has been included as a men's event in all Olympics since the Athens Games in1896, while the women's event did not feature until 104 years later at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. Historically, the United States has been the most successful nation in the pole vault at the Olympics, winning all gold medals between 1896 and 1968 (including two golds for a joint victory in 1908), and currently has 21 golds across the men's and women's events. The current Olympic record for men was set by Brazil's Thiago Braz da Silva in 2016, with a jump of 6.03 meters; and the women's Olympic record was set by Russia's Yelena Isinbayeva in 2008, with a jump of 5.05 meters. Isinbayeva also set the world record for women with a jump of 5.06 meters in 2009, while the men's world record of 6.18 meters was set by Armand Duplantis of Sweden in February 2020. Isinbaya holds another record in the event, as the only woman to have won two Olympic gold medals, in 2004 and 2008; the US' Bob Richards is the only man to have won two golds, in 1952 and 1956. Rules and regulations Although there is much more equipment used for the pole vault than for most other track and field events, the apparatus has arguably fewer restrictions placed upon it than any other event (such as the javelin throw). Athletes can use poles of any length or diameter, and made from any combination of materials. The pole's surface must be smooth, but athletes can use as much tape to the grip and ends of the pole as they like. For the run-up, the runway is at least forty meters in length, and athletes can place two markers on the runway to help them time their jump. After completing the run-up, competitors plant their pole in a meter long box that's sixty centimeters wide at the front, fifteen centimeters wide at the back, and twenty centimeters deep at the back wall. The wall is used by the jumpers as the pivot point before they begin their ascent. In the air Once the jumper's feet leave the ground, there are strict rules about the position of the hands on the pole; the lower hand may be moved upwards, but neither hand can move higher than the upper hand's position upon take off. The crossbar is 4.5 meters in length, and vaulters are allowed to decide what height the crossbar is to be set at before they make each attempt. After three consecutive missed vaults, the competitor is eliminated from the competition. If two or more competitors jump at the same height then the number of missed vaults is used to determine the winner; if the number of faults is the same for each competitor then a jump-off is used to decide the winner (although this is rare). Because of the techniques used in the pole vault, many competitors have backgrounds in gymnastics rather than track and field (although higher speed and power do give a large advantage at the top level).

Music streaming services provide their users with a database compiled of songs, playlists, albums and videos, where content can be accessed online, downloaded, shared, bookmarked and organized. The music streaming business is huge, and has sometimes been lauded as the savior of the music industry. The biggest two services are in constant competition for the monopoly of the market.

Bigger, established stars like Taylor Swift are more likely to regularly make a good amount of money this way. But either way, a track needs to go viral or be streamed several million times before it earns any real cash.

Secondly, Wallonia had an average income higher than in the Brussels-Capital Region. Furthermore, from 2006 to 2017, the increase in income was higher in Flanders than in the other parts of Belgium. Indeed, Flandersâ€?annual income increased by roughly 4,000 euros over this period, whereas Wallonia faced an increase of 3,500 euros. Meanwhile, the Brussels-Capital Region registered an increase of 2,000 euros. In other words, not only did the annual income differ from one region to another, but regional inequalities were also deepening over time. Further uneven distribution of income in Belgium? On a European level, Belgium held the fifth position of the European Union countries with the highest annual salaries in 2017. During that year, the average annual income in Belgium reached 18,331 euros. However, income in Belgium varied by level of education, age, and, still to this day, gender.

 In the past four centuries, the population of the United States has grown from a recorded 350 people around the Jamestown colony of Virginia in 1610, to an estimated 331 million people in 2020. The pre-colonization populations of the indigenous peoples of the Americas have proven difficult for historians to estimate, as their numbers decreased rapidly following the introduction of European diseases (namely smallpox, plague and influenza). Native Americans were also omitted from most censuses conducted before the twentieth century, therefore the actual population of what we now know as the United States would have been much higher than the official census data from before 1800, but it is unclear by how much. Population growth in the colonies throughout the eighteenth century has primarily been attributed to migration from the British Isles and the Transatlantic slave trade; however it is also difficult to assert the ethnic-makeup of the population in these years as accurate migration records were not kept until after the 1820s, at which point the importation of slaves had also been illegalized. Nineteenth century In the year 1800, it is estimated that the population across the present-day United States was around six million people, with the population in the 16 admitted states numbering at 5.3 million. Migration to the United States began to happen on a large scale in the mid-nineteenth century, with the first major waves coming from Ireland, Britain and Germany. In some aspects, this wave of mass migration balanced out the demographic impacts of the American Civil War, which was the deadliest war in U.S. history with approximately 620 thousand fatalities between 1861 and 1865. The civil war also resulted in the emancipation of around four million slaves across the south; many of whose ancestors would take part in the Great Northern Migration in the early 1900s, which saw around six million black Americans migrate away from the south in one of the largest demographic shifts in U.S. history. By the end of the nineteenth century, improvements in transport technology and increasing economic opportunities saw migration to the United States increase further, particularly from southern and Eastern Europe, and in the first decade of the 1900s the number of migrants to the U.S. exceeded one million people in some years. Twentieth and twenty-first century The U.S. population has grown steadily throughout the past 120 years, reaching one hundred million in the 1910s, two hundred million in the 1960s, and three hundred million in 2007. In the past century, the U.S. established itself as a global superpower, with the world's largest economy (by nominal GDP) and most powerful military. Involvement in foreign wars has resulted in over 620,000 further U.S. fatalities since the Civil War, and migration fell drastically during the World Wars and Great Depression; however the population continuously grew in these years as the total fertility rate remained above two births per woman, and life expectancy increased (except during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918). Since the Second World War, Latin America has replaced Europe as the most common point of origin for migrants, with Hispanic populations growing rapidly across the south and border states. Because of this, the proportion of non-Hispanic whites, which has been the most dominant ethnicity in the U.S. since records began, has dropped more rapidly in recent decades. Ethnic minorities also have a much higher birth rate than non-Hispanic whites, further contributing to this decline, and the share of non-Hispanic whites is expected to fall below fifty percent of the U.S. population by the mid-2000s. In 2020, the United States has the third-largest population in the world (after China and India), and the population is expected to reach four hundred million in the 2050s.

 Global clinker capacity totaled and estimated 3.7 billion metric tons in 2019, with China accounting for a vast majority of the worldâ€™s capacity at two billion metric tons. Likewise, China accounted for over half of the worldâ€™s cement production in recent years. Clinker in the United States The United States imported some 1.1 million metric tons of clinker for consumption in 2019; however, domestic production of clinker exceeded imports by a large volume. In recent years, updates to cement plants were undertaken in order to improve the plantsâ€?ability to comply with emissions limits imposed by the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for cement plants. However, under NESHAP, some cement kilns may also be shut down or used less and thus, decrease clinker production capacity. What is the difference between clinker and cement? Cement is a binding material that hardens to connect building units like stones and brick; it is most often used in construction. Clinker, on the other hand, acts primarily as a building block to produce cement. This is achieved through the grinding of clinker along with the addition of other active ingredients. Clinker is a granular substance with spherical pellets, whereas cement is a fine powdery substance. Cement is then further processed to make concrete and mortar and can be used for waterproofing, filling or sealing gaps, and even as decoration.

Life Insurance in the United States The economic and social purpose of life insurance is directed at handling financial guarantees to individuals and families. It provides a safety net to families in case of an unforeseen death of a bread-winning family member. It covers the financial loss that the surviving family will face. Additionally, it provides financial help in case they outlive other forms of income such as a retirement fund. There are three different forms of life insurance products: whole-life, term life, and annuities.

Other highly popular genres included pop and rock music, whereas just 1.1 percent of all music sold in the U.S. in 2018 was jazz. Why are some genres more popular than others? Whilst music is a highly subjective medium in terms of the listenerâ€™s taste and preferences, the top genres in terms of consumption tend not to fluctuate heavily. The catchiness and familiarity of pop music is appealing to a wide range of music fans. Pop songs tend to be easy to listen to and remember, usually feature simple, snappy lyrics to avoid polarizing listeners, making pop overall less divisive than other genres because it is designed to generate mass appeal. Conversely, religious music by its very nature is a niche genre in that it encompasses, describes or advocates certain beliefs, giving it the equal ability to alienate some listeners while appealing enormously to others, depending on their religious stance. The hit genre of 2018 was hip-hop and rap, a music style notorious for its tendency to divide listeners. Singer Drake arguably influenced sales within the genre that year, with â€˜Scorpionâ€?topping the list of best-selling albums in the United States based on total streams and â€˜Scary Hoursâ€?also making the top ten. Drake came tenth in the list of most successful music tours in North America, with revenue from his live concerts amounting to 79 million U.S. dollars, and second in the ranking was Jay-Z and BeyoncÃ© with 166.4 million dollars in revenue, artists whose music is also strongly aligned with the rap and hip-hop genre. Other artists in the genre who achieved significant influence in 2018 include Kendrick Lamar, Childish Gambino, Cardi B, Travis Scott and Post Malone, many of whom released songs that year which garnered hundreds of millions of audio streams. The sheer amount of hip-hop and rap music flooding the music industry has had a profound effect on the genreâ€™s popularity, and musicians in the category tend to be prolific songwriters and active social media users. Equally, artists in the genre are arguably passionate about creating music which challenges social norms in a way that rock music has always been famous for.

Since the first death occurred on the 6th of February in the Netherlands, new casualties were reported daily in the Benelux. Until now, the death tollâ€¯amounted to 18 thousand in Belgium and 10 thousand in the Netherlands, while Luxembourg registered the least deaths. After recording the highest death rate in the world, Belgium's death rate stands under three percent on the 15th of December. Why such a high death rate? Although it is hard to fully explain the different death rates among countries, certain explanations have been put forward more than others. Indeed, as COVID-19 casualties are higher in older patients, countries could face different death tolls due to the different age structures of their population. For instance, 70 percent of deaths in the Netherlands occurred in people aged over 70, and 51 percent of deaths in Belgium occurred in nursing homes. However, in 2020, the Belgian population was not particularly old, especially when compared to countries such as Germany or Japan. Therefore, experts are considering further reasons to fathom such a high death rate. Other explanations As of December, over one million people have been tested positive for the coronavirus in the Benelux, from which 609 thousand in Belgium and 628 thousand in the Netherlands. These numbers solely reflect confirmed and diagnosed cases and not the entire number of sick or infected people. Indeed, numbers depend on the logistic capacity for testing, which can vary from one country to another. The accurate number of Sarscov2 infected people is, therefore, unknown. Meanwhile, the number of deaths due to the virus relies on this unknown number. Moreover, some deaths are not accounted for in the death tolls because not all deaths have been officially linked to the coronavirus. For instance, in France or Italy, COVID-19 death tolls solely include tested casualties while untested deaths are not systematically considered. In Belgium, however, suspected cases are accounted for in the death toll, regardless of the person having been tested or not.

Violent Crime Violent crime includes any crime that incorporates force such as murder, assault and rape, as well as crimes that include the threat of violence such as robbery, harassment and extortion. The tracking of violent crime is usually done through indicators such as a violent crime rate or violent crime severity index. The violent crime rate is usually measured simply by counting all violent crimes per 1,000 inhabitants. The violent crime severity index is a measure of violent crime weighted by the severity of the crime. This indicator was developed in order to provide a clearer picture of serious crimes in Canada that can be hidden in the standard violent crime rate. Violent crime has been steadily declining in Canada for some time now with 2014â€™s violent crime rate of 1,039 being 30 percent lower than the rate in 2000. Violent crime is highest in the territories with Nunavutâ€™s rate, in particular, being over three times higher than the national average.

 The leading reinsurer in the United States as of the fourth quarter in 2019, National Indemnity Company, had 25.78 billion U.S. dollarsâ€?worth of gross premiums written. Reinsurers Reinsurance is a type of insurance that other insurance companies take out to reduce risk. Essentially, it works to restrict the amount of money an insurer can possibly lose and, in turn, protects their own customers from losses. There are two procedures for reinsurance, facultative and treaty. Facultative reinsurance is when an insurance company buys insurance for a specific instance or occurrence. Treaty reinsurance covers a set of predetermined risks over a period of time. Facultative is seen as a one-time deal whereas treaty reinsurance is long term. There are several types of reinsurance which include proportional, non-proportional, risk attaching basis, losses occurring basis, and a claims-made basis. The proportional structure of reinsurance means that the reinsurer will handle a part of the losses, in which it gets a prorated share of the insurerâ€™s premiums. The non-proportional reinsurance structure means the agreement will start when the insurerâ€™s losses surpass a certain amount. Leading companies In 2018, National Indemnity Co. was the leading reinsurer in net premiums earned that year, having a significant lead over all other companies.

 The opening day payroll of teams in the MLB is calculated by combining the base salary, incentives, and any signing bonuses. At the beginning of the 2020 season, the New York Yankees had the highest combined payroll in the league, amounting to over 254 million U.S. dollars. At the other end of the scale, the Miami Marlins had an opening day payroll of just under 59 million U.S. dollars. Pitchers take home the money The MLB has a minimum player salary in place to ensure that its professionals are rewarded for the work that they do. In 2019, the minimum salary for an MLB player was 555 thousand U.S. dollars per year, a significant increase from the minimum of 400 thousand U.S. dollars ten years earlier. However, the average player salary in the league in 2019 stood at 4.36 million U.S. dollars, almost eight times the value of the minimum salary. This figure is skewed by the fact that the top earners in baseball take home significant amounts of money. Typically, it is the pitchers within a baseball team that earn the biggest wages due to their integral role. Indeed, pitchers dominated the list of highest earning players in the MLB, with Stephen Strasburg topping the list. The pitcher for the Washington Nationals took home an eye-watering 38.33 million U.S. dollars in 2019.

This tax is paid by any teams whose annual payroll exceeds the league limit which, in 2019, stood at 206 million U.S. dollars. In the 2018 season, a combined total of 14.34 million U.S. dollars was paid in Competitive Balance Tax by the teams of the MLB.

 In 2018, the national debt of India amounted to around 1.8 trillion U.S. dollars. Projections show an upward trend, with a significant increase each year. Honor thy national debt National debt, also called government debt or public debt, is money owed by the federal government. It can be divided into internal debt, (which is owed to lenders in the country) and external debt (which is owed to foreign lenders). National debt is created and increased by using government bonds, for example, or by borrowing money from other nations due to financial struggles (well-known case in point: Greece). A quite complex issue, national debt is expected to be paid back in accordance with certain regulations overseen by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), a financial organization owned by central banks. Indiaâ€™s debt is rising, but so is its economic growth Indiaâ€™s liabilities have increased significantly, and forecasts show no end in sight. While India is a fast-growing economy and considered one of the main emerging economies, the so-called BRIC countries, India has been investing and borrowing money from commercial banks as well as several non-banking finance companies, and its national debt today makes up almost 70 percent of its GDP. Luckily, even though the national debt is forecast to increase, this share of GDP is predicted to decrease, as is the trade deficit in the long run, despite a significant jump back into the red in 2017.

In 2015, the literacy rate, which is defined as people aged 15 and above who can read and write, had reached about 96.4 percent in China.Literacy and education in China â€?additional information By 2012, 84 percent of the world population aged 15 years and above had been able to read and write. While in developed regions this figure ranged a lot higher, only 60 percent of the African population was literate. Countries with the lowest literacy rates are also the most underdeveloped worldwide. According to UNESCO, literacy is a human right, especially in a fast-changing and technology-driven world. In China, the literacy rate has developed from 79 percent in 1982 to 97 percent in 2010, indicating that almost one million people per year have become literate over the past three decades. In India, the situation was entirely different. The second most populous country in the world displayed a literacy rate of merely 75 percent in 2006. The dramatic increase in literacy in China has a lot to do with the efficacy of numerous political, economic and educational policies. In 1982, compulsory education was written into the Chinese constitution, postulating a nine-year compulsory education funded by the government. As is shown by the graph above, there was a large gender gap in literacy rate in China as of 1982. Though this gap still existed in 2010, it was narrowed down to 5.7 percent, starting from 28 percent in 1982. Since 1990, the national education policy was directed at females, especially from poor and/or minority families. Over the past years, China has achieved gender parity in primary schooling. However, regional literacy disparities in China should not to be overlooked. Regions with a strong economic background tend to display illiteracy rates below national average. In contrast, economically underdeveloped regions have a much larger share of people who cannot read nor write. Tibet for instance, a region where 92 percent of the population belong to an ethnic minority, showed the highest illiterate rate nationwide, with almost 35 percent in 2012.

 Production of natural gas in the United States has been increasing for the past decade and amounted to 920.9 billion cubic meters in 2019. An increase in production corresponded with rising demand for natural gas in the United States, particularly afterâ€¯the 2008 Recession. Natural gas becomes competitive Since the early 2000s, the price of coal had been going up, and increased more rapidly following the 2008 Recession, which affected the cost of crude oil to an even greater degree. When the price of crude oil peaked shortly after the financial crisis, consumption of petroleum decreased in the next year. Simultaneously, the cost of natural gas dramatically decreased, making it a stronger competitor with coal and petroleum.

Often obtained through fracking, shale gas has become a common form of natural gas, and shale gas production in the United States has increased dramatically since the financial crisis.

 The statistic shows the proportion of the population with access to at least basic and limited drinking water services in selected world regions in 2017. That year, 92 percent of the population in Northern Africa had access at least basic drinking water services. Access to safe drinking waterImproved drinking water refers to a source that can be adequately protected from outside contamination, mostly by fecal matter. An improved sanitation facility keeps human waste out of reach, for example, by using a flush toilet or a septic tank. These protected sources include rainwater, protected springs, and piped water into a dwelling. Global investments in water supply infrastructure are expected to increase. Investment targeting distribution infrastructure is projected to reach 61 billion U.S. dollars by 2016. In most regions of the world, 90 percent of the population has access to at least basic drinking water services. However, only 61 percent of the population in sub-Saharan Africa and 55 percent of the population in Oceania have basic access. In sub-Saharan Africa, about 18 percent of people only have access to unimproved water sources and eight percent only have access to surface waters. Unimproved water sources include bottled water and tanker-trucks. Currently, eight out of ten people living in rural areas still lack even basic drinking water services, however, between 2000 and 2017 some 1.8 billion people gained access to at least basic service. Rural coverage of safely managed water services has also increased. A lack of access to safe water is considered one of the top risks based on impact to global societies.

The United States' economy over the last decade The United States of America is the worldâ€™s largest national economy and the second most prominent trader globally, trailing just behind China. The country is also one of the most populated countries in the world, trailing only China and India. The United States' economy prospers primarily due to having a plentiful amount of natural resources and advanced infrastructure to cope with the production of goods and services, as well as the population and workforce to enable high productivity. Efficient productivity led to a slight growth in GDP almost every year over the past decade, despite undergoing several economic hardships towards the late 2000's. In addition, the United States holds arguably one of the most important financial markets, with the majority of countries around the world having commercial connections with American companies. Dependency on a single market like the United States has however caused several global dilemmas, most evidently seen during the 2008 financial crisis. What initially started off as a bursting of the U.S. housing bubble lead to a worldwide recession and the necessity to reform national economics. The global financial crisis affected the United States most drastically, especially within the unemployment market as well as national debt, which continued to rise due to the United States having to borrow money in order to stimulate its economy.

 The state of Ohio has taken part in 55 U.S. presidential elections, voting for the nationwide winner in 45 of these elections, giving a success rate of 82 percent. With this high success rate and relatively high number of electoral votes, Ohio has generally been viewed as a battleground state throughout U.S. history. Before 2020, Ohio had voted for the overall winner in every election since 1964, and had only failed to choose the winner in three elections since 1888. In the 2020 election, however, the Buckeye State somewhat lost its reputation as a bellweather state, as Donald Trump carried the popular vote by an 8.1 percent margin; the same margin as his victory in 2016. Ohioans in office Seven U.S. president were born in Ohio, which is the second highest number after Virginia's eight presidents. Despite being the birthplace of so many presidents, all of these men served in office between 1869 and 1925, meaning that seven of the ten presidents who served between these years were from Ohio; the first was Ulysses S. Grant, who was first elected in 1868, and the final was Warren G. Harding, who was elected in 1920. No other major party candidate, before or after these years, was born in Ohio; although William Henry Harrison did live and hold public office there before winning the 1840 election. Electoral votes Ohio's allocation of electoral votes has been among the highest in the country since the 1820s, staying between 21 and 26 votes between the 1832 and 2008 elections. However, after peaking at 26 votes in the 1960s, Ohio's allocation of votes has gradually fallen to just 18 votes in recent elections, and is expected to fall again in the 2024 election. It remains to be seen whether Ohio will regain its reputation as a key battleground state in future elections.

 This statistic displays the proportion of individuals who currently smoke cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos or a pipe in selected European countries in 2017. In this period, Greece had the highest proportion of smokers in the EU with 37 percent. Cigarette prices differ across Europe: the most expensive country in which to purchase cigarettes is the United Kingdom (UK). Cigarette prices in Europe are driven by the respective taxes imposed within each of the member states and consist of a specific duty per 1,000 cigarettes and an ad valorem rate onto the recommended retail price, in addition to value added tax (VAT). Thus the highest rates of taxation are reflected in the retail prices. Similar rates of taxation between countries are also found for hand rolling tobacco, where the highest levels of taxation are found in the United Kingdom once again. Governments that impose such strong barriers to the purchasing of tobacco are considered 'nanny states', with high levels of control on other factors, such as advertising, bans of tobacco products on retail displays and graphic warnings on cigarette packs.

 The men's 800m is classified as a middle-distance race, and has been a staple men's event at the Olympics since the Athens 1896. A female event was introduced once in 1928, but was then dropped as some press reports claimed that it was too long a distance for women and caused distress among the athletes (although many competitors and spectators refuted these claims); the women's event was re-introduced in 1960 and has been a permanent fixture since. Unlike shorter races, competitors in the 800m are allowed to converge in the inside lane once they pass the first band (after the first 100 meters); for this reason, the 800m is seen as a more tactical race that requires a balance of both aerobic and anaerobic ability, in contrast to the sprints across the shorter distances. Records The Olympic and world record for men (100.91 seconds) was set in London in 2012 by David Rudesha of Kenya, while the women's Olympic record (113.43 seconds) was set by the Soviet Union's Nadezhda Olizarenko in 1980, and the women's world record (113.28 seconds) was set by Czechoslovakia's Jarmila KratochvÃ­lovÃ¡ in 1983; the women's records are two of the longest standing athletics records ever. Four men have won back-to-back gold medals (most recently by Rudesha in 2016), and South Africa's Caster Semenya became the first woman to do so in 2016. Cuban runner Alberto Juantorena (in 1976) is the only athlete to have won both the 400m and 800m events, although a number of 800m athletes have also taken the gold in the 1500m event (particularly in the earlier Olympics). Most successful nations Historically, athletes from the United States have won the most gold medals across both events, with eight golds and 21 overall medals in the men's event, while the Soviet Union was the most successful nation in the women's event; however, recent decades have seen African athletes, particularly Kenyans, dominate the medal tables.

 This statistic shows the total population of Syria from 2000 to 2010. In 2010, the total population of Syria was at approximately 21.4 million inhabitants. The Syrian refugee crisis The war in Syria has been escalating since 2011, which has made it difficult to estimate the current population of the country. The population of the country was last determined to be over 21 million in 2010. Previously, population growth rates had been relatively high, but since the war, Syria has been experiencing the opposite, and now claims the highest rate of population decline in the world. Large numbers of Syrians have been fleeing the county and others have lost their lives due to the conflict within the countryâ€™s borders. As of October 2015, the total number of casualties had risen to over 250,000 - including around 116,000 civilians and about 13,000 children. This has caused more than 4 million people to flee the country, making it the worst refugee crisis of our generation. Still, millions more have also been internally displaced and the sheer scale of the crisis is evident. Neighboring counties have received large numbers of Syrian refugees, but the crisis is now being felt across Europe as thousands of refugees are risking their lives everyday migrating to Europe in search of a brighter future. European cooperation is needed and not all countries are meeting Europeâ€™s migrant quota.

 Inflation in Myanmar dropped to a five-year low in 2017, settling at 4.62 percent. This is down from a fairly high spike in 2016, expected to converge to a steady state around 6 percent in the coming years. For a developing economy, this is an acceptable level, though Myanmarâ€™s central bankers would probably prefer one or two percentage points less. What is inflation? Inflation is the rise in prices over time. This is often caused by economic growth, and economists consider low, stable growth to be a sign of a healthy economy. The unemployment rate can also cause inflation if it is too low because businesses have to offer higher wages to attract workers. The firms raise prices to pay these higher wages, driving up inflation. Myanmar may be different While the unemployment rate is very low, other indicators may reveal that the labor market still has some slack. Myanmar does not publish the workforce particiaption rate, but one can infer by the low rate of urbanization that many workers may engage in subsistance agriculture or simply not search for jobs, keeping them out of the unemployment statistic. Similarly, the low gross domestic product (GDP) per capita may cause workers to stay with a job that is not a good match simply because they do not think they can find another. The hope is that the higher inflation rate will have upward pressure on wages, bringing more wealth to the people of Myanmar.

This division has deep historical roots reflecting the geography of each region and their political past and present. Furthermore, regional economic development closely correlates with regional urbanization rates, which closely resembles the borders of the four main economic regions. Private income in different parts of China Breaking the average income figures further down by province, municipality, or autonomous region reveals that the average disposable income in Shanghai or Beijing is on average roughly four times higher than in Tibet or Gansu province. In rural areas, average disposable income is often only between one third and one half of that in urban areas of the same region. Accordingly, consumer expenditure per capita in urban areas reaches the highest levels in Shanghai, Beijing, and the coastal regions of China.

 This statistic shows the average inflation rate in Malaysia from 1985 to 2019, with projections up to 2025. In 2019, the average inflation rate in Malaysia amounted to about 0.66 percent compared to the previous year. Malaysia's economy is slowly recovering The inflation rate is the annual rate of increase of a price index, normally the consumer price index over time. If the same item bought today for 1 U.S. dollar is bought again one year from now, but for 1.03 U.S. dollars, then the inflation rate is at 3 percent. Generally, a low inflation rate is sought by every country, and a rate of 3 percent, as is estimated for Malaysia in the next few years, is considered low. However, there was a slight rise in Malaysiaâ€™s inflation rate, from close to 2 percent in 2010 to a little over 3 percent in 2011. In 2012, it dropped back down to its normal rate, but future estimates predict a slight increase once again. Perhaps this increase has come from initial worries concerning the countryâ€™s slowing economy as the countryâ€™s GDP growth slowed from 7.43 percent in 2010 to 5.19 percent in 2011, or its negative budget balance in relation to GDP which was at its recent worst in 2010 at -4.66 percent. At the same time, the countryâ€™s national debt was also rising, but predictions show that this trend is reversing. Yet, the economic outlook and inflation rate still appear stable for the future of Malaysia, and the inflation rate is below the global inflation rate. Furthermore, the countryâ€™s GDP continues to rise and totaled 326.93 billion U.S. dollars in 2013.

Kenyaâ€™s unemployment rate was 2.64 percent in 2019. This represents a steady decline from the increase after the financial crisis. What is unemployment? The unemployment rate of a country refers to the share of people who want to work but cannot find jobs. This includes workers who have lost jobs and are searching for new ones, workers whose jobs ended due to an economic downturn, and workers for whom there are no jobs because the labor supply in their industry is larger than the number of jobs available. Different statistics suggest which factors contribute to the overall unemployment rate. The Kenyan context The first type, so-called â€œsearch unemploymentâ€? is hardest to see in the data. The closest proxy is Kenyaâ€™s inflation rate. As workers take new jobs faster, employers are forced to increase wages, leading to higher employment. Jobs lost due to economic downturns, called â€œcyclical unemploymentâ€? can be seen by decreases in the GDP growth rate, which are not significant in Kenya. Finally, â€œstructural unemploymentâ€?refers to workers changing the industry, or even economic sector, in which they are working. In Kenya, more and more workers switch to the services sector. This is often a result of urbanization, but any structural shift in the economyâ€™s composition can lead to this unemployment.

The cheapest average tickets in the 2014 season were found at the FirstEnergy Stadium, home to the Cleveland Browns. Here the average ticket retailed at 54.20 U.S. dollars, the same price it has been since 2010. However, the 2014 season was a disappointing one for Cleveland because, after a positive start, they lost their final five games to finish last in the AFC North. The league-wide average ticket cost 84.43 U.S. dollars in 2014. This is an increase of three U.S. dollars on the previous season and a rise of over twenty U.S. dollars since 2006. The average ticket price in the MLB has increased steadily since 2006, with the figure at just under 28 U.S. dollars in 2014. This is nevertheless considerably lower than the other major sports leagues in the United States, whose average tickets all retail at over 50 U.S. dollars. In the 2014 MLB season, the Boston Red Sox had the highest average ticket prices at over 52 U.S. dollars. In comparison, fans of the San Diego Padres paid an average of less than 17 U.S. dollars to watch their team play in 2014. The Fan Cost Index, which calculates the cost of taking an average family to an MLB game, also estimated that watching the Boston Red Sox was the most costly day out in the MLB as a family would spend an average of over 350 U.S. dollars on tickets, refreshments, and merchandise. The cheapest experience could be had at an Arizona Diamondbacks game, where a family would spend an average of just under 127 U.S. dollars.

 In the last couple decades, the price of natural gas used for electricity generation has increased slightly to 2.89 U.S. dollars per million British thermal units (Btu) in 2019. The price of coal was about 2.02 U.S. dollars per million Btu. The cost of using some fossil fuels to generate electricity has been recently found to be more expensive than renewable energy. Natural gas is cheapest in regions like the Coastal Plain, where natural gas production is high. Shift Away from Conventional Energy Sources Although renewable technologies were once thought to be very expensive, the rapid advancement of these technologies have quickly rendered the cost of energy generation at a level on par to conventional fossil fuels. The aging coal fleet is a prime example of the increasing necessity to switch to carbon neutral technologies. Older coal plants are dealing with increasing maintenance costs as well as environmental regulations forcing the installation of pollution controls. Demand for natural gas is also impacting coal demand. Unlike wind and solar resources, natural gas resources seem to be sensitive to carbon prices.

A noticeable drop in life expectancy appeared between 1915 and 1920, as the Spanish Flu epidemic that swept the globe impacted the population of Afghanistan severely. (A second drop can be observed in the early 1950s, however this is due to contrasting sources, as more recent data from the UN becomes available). Despite continuous war in the country since the late 1970s, medical advancements have brought Afghanistan's life expectancy closer to the global average in recent decades. 
 The majority of Japanese adhere to Shintoism, a traditional Japanese religion focusing on rituals and worship at shrines. In 2017, around 70 percent of the total population of Japan participated in Shinto practices. Closely behind is Buddhism, with more than 69 percent of the population adhering to its practices. Most Japanese thus practice both religions. The original Shinto Shintoism adherents worship spirits or gods at shrines, often publicly, through rituals and traditions. Shintoism is deeply ingrained in the Japanese culture and way of life, but the number of followers has been decreasing over the past years, as has the number of Japanese who are adhering to any kind of religion. Tradition seems to have to make way for modern attitudes and choices â€?still the number of people who call themselves Shinto adherents is quite high, even if they do not actively practice it. Everything zen in Buddhism While Shintoism seems to become a thing of the past, the number of Buddhists, on the other hand, has been stable over the last decade, and if anything, has only slightly decreased. Japan is, in fact, among the countries with the largest Buddhist communities, right after China, of course, and Thailand. This might be due to Buddhism being able to adapt much easier to modern times and its adherentsâ€?everyday lives, as well as a better PR machine â€?Buddhism is, after all, also quite popular in the Western world.

China is the worldâ€™s most populous country and its rapid economic development over the past decades has profited greatly from its large labor market.

Economic slowdown - impact on labor market After decades of rapid development, the worldâ€™s second largest economy now seems to have difficulties to boost its economy further. The GDP growth rate fell to a new record low and the number of employed people decreased for the first time since decades in 2018. Under the influence of the global economic downturn and the US-China trade war, many Chinese enterprises engaged in international trade are having tough times, which leads to a recession in Chinaâ€™s labor market. Chances for better employment situation After numerous discussions, itâ€™s still not clear if the United States and China will sign a trade deal in the next months. The long-lasting trade war has caused China great loss on its international trade sector, which has been driving Chinaâ€™s economic growth for decades. However, there is also a lot China could improve. First, the potential of domestic demands could be further developed and satisfied with high-quality products. Second, itâ€™s a good timing to eliminate backward industries with low value added, and the high-tech and environment-friendly industries should be further promoted. In addition, Chinaâ€™s market could be more open to services, especially in the financial sector and IT services, to attract more foreign investors. Highly skilled talents should be better valued in the labor market. Efficient vocational education and further education could also help change the structure of Chinaâ€™s labor market.

However, the future looks better - GDP per capita is expected to increase at a higher rate than previously due to strong economic growth that is projected. Low inflation will also help. The country is expected to experience growth rates in the range of 3 to 5 percent each year. This growth is a result of a diversified economy and a push towards advancing the industrial sector. It is hoped that advancements in the industrial sector will help reduce stubbornly high unemployment which is expected to remain above 9 percent. Currently, 13 percent of economic growth is attributed to the agricultural sector - but production capacity is largely dependent on annual rainfall -, close to 30 percent pertains to the industrial sector and another 60 percent pertains to services. GDP growth in Morocco has also benefitted from the drop in oil prices, as it is import-dependent regarding its energy supply. However, Morocco must prepare itself for when prices rise to previous levels again. However, overall, the outlook for Morocco is bright, but it will need to focus on competitiveness and productivity.

Regional differences in China China is the worldâ€™s most populous country, with an exceptional economic growth momentum. The country can be roughly divided into three regions: Western, Eastern, and Central China. Western China covers the most remote regions from the sea. It also has the highest proportion of minority population and the lowest levels of economic output. Eastern China, on the other hand, enjoys a high level of economic development and international corporations. Central China lags behind in comparison to the booming coastal regions. In order to accelerate the economic development of Western and Central Chinese regions, the PRC government has ramped up several incentive plans such as â€˜Rise of Central Chinaâ€?and â€˜China Western Developmentâ€? Economic power of different provinces When observed individually, some provinces could stand an international comparison. Jiangxi province, for example, a medium-sized Chinese province, had a population size comparable to Ukraine or Argentina in 2019. That year, the GDP of Zhejiang, an eastern coastal province, even exceeded the economic output of Sweden. In terms of per capita annual income, the municipality of Shanghai reached a level close to that of South Africa. Nevertheless, as shown by the Gini Index, Chinaâ€™s economic spur leaves millions of people in dust. Among the various kinds of economic inequality in China, regional or the so-called coast-inland disparity is one of the most significant. Posing as evidence for the rather large income gap in China, the poorest province Gansu had a per capita income similar to that of Sri Lanka that year.

The Great Pandemic of the 1870s, which was the last major smallpox pandemic in Europe, caused the number of smallpox deaths to soar once more, peaking at over 1,000 deaths per million people in England and Wales in 1871, and at over 820 deaths per million people in Scotland in 1872. During this pandemic, mandatory vaccination became enforced, where parents who did not vaccinate their children within the first three years of life were penalized with fines or imprisonment, and this helped the smallpox death rate to remain low and plateau in the final two decades of the nineteenth century; an estimated 11,000 of these penalties were handed out during the 1880s, which included 115 prison sentences for failure to vaccinate children. Smallpox cases in Britain were rare throughout the early twentieth century; not counting a lab accident in 1978 that infected two people (one of whom died), natural smallpox cases were eradicated in Britain in 1934.

 In 2019, the total population of Taiwan grew to approximately 23.6 million people. According to national projections, population numbers are expected to enter a general declining path in 2020. Taiwan's demographic developmentTaiwan experienced rapid population growth in the 1950s and 60s, but alongside with economic development, growth rates decreased significantly. Falling birth figures have also been attributed to Taiwanâ€™s family planning policy, which was aimed at keeping population growth at check. This led to a situation on the island where overall population density was very high and still growing, while the total fertility rate dropped quickly and eventually reached extremely low levels compared internationally. In the 21st century, the challenges of a quickly aging society became more and more apparent and the government initiated family friendly and birth promoting policies. However, fertility still kept on decreasing and reached a historical low in 2010 at 0.9 births per woman on average, and only in recent years has the number of births increased slightly. Implications of an aging society Today's Taiwan, like many East Asian societies, faces the challenges of a rapidly aging population.

This puts heavy pressure on the working people and the economy as a whole. However, compared to mainland China, which is in a very much comparable demographic situation, Taiwan enjoys the advantage of a relatively wealthy society, which helps to curb the negative economic effects of an aging population.

 China and the United States are the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the world by far, releasing 10 and five billion metric tons of CO2 respectively in 2018. However, whilst emissions in the United States have declined since 2008, Chinaâ€™s carbon emissions have increased significantly. In 2018, China was responsible for 27.5 percent of global fossil fuel emissions. Cumulative emissions Although China is currently the largest producer of CO2 emissions, its cumulative emissions are considerably less than the United States. Since 1750, the U.S. has released almost 400 billion metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, though most of this has occurred in the last century. The wide gap is mainly because China is still a developing nation. Since 1990, per capita territorial CO2 emissions in China have increased by 240 percent. In comparison, per capita emissions in the west have noticeably dropped. In late 2020, President Xi Jinping announced that China would hit peak emissions before 2030, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Impact of COVID-19 on emissions Although global greenhouse gas levels have been rising annually for some time, the impact of COVID-19 on emissions has resulted in the biggest drop in CO2 emissions ever. This was mainly due to energy demand falling because of strict lockdowns, as well as transportation bans.

 During a survey in June 2019, it was found that just 14 percent of U.S. adults visited a movie theater one or more times per month, but 46 percent stated that they went to the cinema to watch a movie once or year or less. Another survey earlier in the same year revealed that visits to the cinema can vary according to generation. On average, 34 percent of Gen Xers had seen one movie within the last month, compared to 43 percent of those classed as being members of Generation Z. Meanwhile, Boomers had seen far fewer movies recently than their younger counterparts. Why donâ€™t more people visit movie theaters? The reticence to go to cinema to watch a movie could have to do with rising ticket prices in North American movie theaters. Back in 2001, the average ticket price was 5.66 U.S. dollars. Five years later in 2006, this price had risen to 6.55 dollars. In 2018, a visit to the movies cost 9.11 U.S. dollars per ticket on average. This means that the cost of seeing a movie has almost doubled in 17 years. Admittedly the increase in price has been gradual, growing by roughly 10 to 50 cents each year, which doesnâ€™t sound like much. However, for a family of four in 2018 the cost of a trip to the movies could amount to over 35 dollars, and thatâ€™s without any trimmings like popcorn, soda or snacks, which moviegoers say they like to buy. Is streaming affecting movie theater attendance? It has been noted that the growth of entertainment options offered by streaming services could have an effect on whether or not people are willing to leave their homes to visit a movie theater. Why leave the house and pay around nine dollars per ticket when you already pay for a streaming subscription and can choose from hundreds of different movies from the comfort of your own couch? The sheer amount of options on platforms like Netflix make it all too easy for film lovers to decide against going out and to spend their dollars on subscription upgrades instead of cinema tickets. Itâ€™s hard to ignore that times are changing and that movie theater attendance may never be what it once was. But, as long as streaming services continue to offer an abundance of films within different genres from all across the world, the movie fans out there will still have a way to engage with film in the way they choose.

To calculate brand values the Royalty Relief method was used. This approach assumes the company doesn't own their brand and must license it from a theoretical third party. The method determines how much it would cost to do this.

Smoking cannabis in handmade cigarettes utilizes the dried flower form of the product. With the recent legalization of the manufacturing and sale of e-cigarettes in Canada, it is likely that an increasing number of consumers will use vape pens to inhale this herbal form in the future. Cannabis can also be combined with food and drink products. Baked goods such as cookies and brownies are the type of cannabis edible most consumers are interested in trying.Cannabis regulation in Canada Regulation of the drug is not a straight forward topic, there has been issues keeping up with demand and not everyone agrees with the legalization of non-medical marijuana.

For comparison, the Greek debt amounted to approximately 303 billion euros that same year. In a ranking of debt to GDP per country, Ireland is thus currently ranked tenth, while Greece is ranked second. Ireland and the economic crisis Ireland has been severely affected by the economic crisis owing mainly to the bursting of its real estate bubble in 2007. The crisis led to a dramatic decline in real estate prices and was a major factor in the financial and banking crisis, causing Ireland to enter recession in 2008 â€?which means that the economy underwent a period of decline, unemployment figures soared, numerous bankruptcies resulted and many businesses were forced into closure, and inflation and GDP declined. Irelandâ€™s budget balance seems to be in remission from a severe state deficit in 2010. It continues to show negative figures to this day. Ireland was not the only country to be hit severely by the economic crisis, other countries are also suffering: Portugal, for example, reported an ever higher national debt than Ireland in 2012 and an even higher state deficit. Spain is another casualty; it has been reporting extraordinarily high unemployment figures since 2008, the rate of unemployment is still on the rise . The country suffering most due to the economic crisis, however, was and still is Greece, with a national debt almost one-and-a-half times as large as Irelandâ€™s at times, and an unemployment rate to rival that of Spain, as well as a devastated economy. As for Ireland, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union's European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) agreed to support the country financially with a loan in 2010. However, the country is still not out of recession and might struggle to secure economic recovery for another few years at least.

 In 2019, a square meter for retail space in Venice cost on average 4.3 thousand euros, making it the most expensive city in Italy for retailers. The ranking presented in the graph shows that Milan, the Italian fashion capital, came second, with an average price per square meter of 3.54 thousand euros. When looking at office space, Venice boasted again the highest prices in Italy. In this real estate segment, second in the ranking was Rome, followed by Milan. Residential real estate in Venice Venice is not only the most expensive city in Italy for office and retail spaces, but it also boasts some of the highest prices for residential properties. Residential dwellings on the island can fetch on average from 4.2 to 5.7 thousand euros per square meter, with the most expensive areas being the districts San Marco and Rialto. Renting is not very affordable either: a flat in the two districts cost on average approximately 16 euros per square meter per month. Why is Venice so expensive? Space in Venice is limited, and the city island became the victim of its own success. The number of overnight stays in Venice grew twofold since 2003 and the trend is not going to invert in the future. The unavailability of space for new constructions and the increasing pressure exerted by tourism pushed prices up in all real estate sectors. Due to many tourists visiting from all over the world, it should not come as a surprise that retailers and investors want to seize the chance to own a space in one of the most famous cities in the world.

 Despite the average daily time spent reading per capita in the United States decreasing in recent years, the average amount of time spent reading the Bible has remained stable. A survey showed that 23 percent of U.S. adults reported spending one hour of more with the bible in each sitting in 2017, compared to 24 percent four years earlier. The Bible: consumption in the United States The frequency of reading the Bible among adults in the U.S. changed very little between 2018 and 2019, however reading habits among survey respondents were at two extremes. Whilst the majority reported never reading the Bible at all, the second largest share of adults said that they read the text every day. Whilst the average time spent with the Bible has only very mildly fluctuated over the last few years, attitudes and consumption habits are changing. Back in 2011, 67 percent of surveyed U.S. adults said that they wished they used the Bible more, however by 2019 this figure had dropped to 56 percent. In addition to this, digital formats have become more prevalent and have proved more appealing to younger readers than to older generations. Print is still by far the most popular format, however more Millennials and Gen-Xers prefer to read the Bible via a smartphone or tablet app than their older peers, and the frequency of reading online versions of the Bible was also higher among younger generations. Whilst to older generations using digital versions of religious or sacred texts may seem strange or even a step too far, clearly a demand for such content exists. The Bible app came second in a ranking of the highest rated iOS apps in the United States with over 97 percent positive user reviews â€?thatâ€™s almost ten percent more than Spotify. With consumers all over the world making the move from print to digital, it is possible that digital versions of the Bible will increase in popularity even further, though there will likely always be groups who simply believe such a text should be kept in its traditional format.

In 2019, the gross domestic product per capita in the United States amounted to around 65,253.52 U.S. dollars. Thus, the United States is one of the countries with the largest GDP per capita worldwide. See the U.S. GDP growth rate here and the US GDP for further information. For comparison, per capita GDP in China had reached about 5,523 U.S. dollars in 2011. Gross domestic product of the United States The gross domestic product (GDP) of a country is an economic key figure, as it represents the market value of goods and services produced in a country within one year. The United Statesâ€?GDP) is increasing consistently, and it is expected to continue growing. On a global scale, the U.S. share of GDP adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity has been in the range of 20 percent over the last few years, give or take a few percentage points. The United States has the largest GDP worldwide, with a significant lead over China, Japan and Germany. Gross domestic product per capita is annual GDP divided by the average population from the same year, which allows for a GDP calculation per inhabitant of a country. Thus, a country with a high GDP, like the United States, can still have a low GDP per capita. Consequently, if compared to other countries, the United States does not rank among the top ten on this list .

 Of all the countries in the world, China had, by far, the largest international reserves in August 2020, with 3.46 trillion U.S. dollars in reserves and foreign currency liquidity. Japan and Switzerland were the only other countries with over a trillion U.S. dollars in reserves, with a total of 1.51 trillion U.S. dollars and 1.003 trillion U.S. dollars respectively. Why do countries hold reserves? A simple explanation for Chinaâ€™s accumulation of foreign currency could be its consistently positive and substantial trade balance. When China exports goods and services, it accepts the foreign currency, usually U.S. dollars, and holds that currency in reserve. In addition to facilitating trade, most countries, including China, also hold foreign exchange reserves to ensure the stability of their currencies and facilitate other foreign transactions. Other significant reserves Even though most of the world left the gold standard in 1971, most countries still retain large gold reserves. The United States, followed by Germany and Italy, held the largest amount of gold reserves worldwide as of December 2018.

In 2011, the alliance between General Electric and Hitachi was ranked as the third largest maker of nuclear reactors, behind Franceâ€™s Areva and Russia-based Rosatom. In 2050, global nuclear power capacity is projected to reach 506 gigawatts. History of nuclear energy generation In 1954, history was made when nuclear fission technology was approved for commercial purposes and the first nuclear power plant started operation in the Russian city of Obninsk. For the first time, it was possible to meet the demand of an increasingly energy-thirsty world â€?at a reasonable price, too. The new energy proved to be an extremely reliable and stable form of electricity. Since nuclear power plants are only shut down for refuelling every two years or so, they provide an around-the-clock â€œbaseloadâ€?supply of power to the people. In nuclear fission, uranium atoms are split apart into lighter elements. Uranium is a radioactive metal that is extracted from mines, mainly in Kazakhstan, Canada and Australia. After the uranium splitting process, the used fuel elements are still radioactive and have to be stored in nuclear waste repositories or spent fuel pools. These sites are often underground and require thick metal or concrete walls to shield the public from radiation.

 Humans have been living on the continent of Australia (name derived from "Terra Australis"; Latin for "the southern land") for approximately 65,000 years, however population growth was relatively slow until the nineteenth century. Europeans had made some contact with Australia as early as 1606, however there was no significant attempt at settlement until the late eighteenth century. By 1800, the population of Australia was approximately 350,000 people, and the majority of these were Indigenous Australians. As colonization progressed the number of ethnic Europeans increased while the Australian Aboriginal population was decimated through conflict, smallpox and other diseases, with some communities being exterminated completely, such as Aboriginal Tasmanians. Mass migration from Britain and China After the loss of its American colonies in the 1780s, the British Empire looked to other parts of the globe to expand its sphere of influence. In Australia, the first colonies were established in Sydney, Tasmania and Western Australia. Many of these were penal colonies which became home to approximately 164,000 British and Irish convicts who were transported to Australia between 1788 and 1868. As the decades progressed, expansion into the interior intensified, and the entire country was claimed by Britain in 1826. Inland colonization led to further conflict between European settlers and indigenous Australians, which cost the lives of thousands of natives. Inward expansion also saw the discovery of many natural resources, and most notably led to the gold rushes of the 1850s, which attracted substantial numbers of Chinese migrants to Australia. This mass migration from non-European countries eventually led to some restrictive policies being introduced, culminating with the White Australia Policy of 1901, which cemented ethnic-European dominance in Australian politics and society. These policies were not retracted until the second half of the 1900s. Independent Australia Australia changed its status to a British dominion in 1901, and eventually became independent in 1931. Despite this, Australia has remained a part of the British Commonwealth, and Australian forces (ANZAC) fought with the British and their Allies in both World Wars, and were instrumental in campaigns such as Gallipoli in WWI, and the South West Pacific Theater in WWII. The aftermath of both wars had a significant impact on the Australian population, with approximately 90 thousand deaths in both world wars combined, as well as 15 thousand deaths as a result of the Spanish flu pandemic following WWI, although Australia experienced a significant baby boom following the Second World War. In the past fifty years, Australia has promoted immigration from all over the world, and now has one of the strongest economies and highest living standards in the world, with a population that has grown to over 25 million people in 2020.

Coal energy is primarily used for the electric power sector. In 2018, the industrial sector accounted for 1.2 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) while the electric power sector accounted for 12.1 quadrillion Btu. An Edison plant was built for New York City in 1882 and was the first coal-fired electricity plant in the United States. By the 1950s, coal was considered the leading source of fuel for electricity generation. Declines in coal usage occurred around 2007, amidst the increased availability of renewables and natural gas. Environmental concerns surrounding coal and its emissions have also driven its gradual decline. The use of coal plants has been linked to acid rain, various emissions, and mercury pollution. The United States was the second largest consumer of coal in the world, totaling 453.4 million metric tons of oil equivalents (mtoe).

Among the largest cities in Mexico, Mexico City is leading with more than 8.5 million inhabitants. A slowly declining fertility rate still holds above the replacement rate, and life expectancy is growing, expanding the population from both ends of the age spectrum. With the rising life expectancy, the median age of Mexican residents has also increased, and an increasing stream of immigrants from the financially-troubled Spain has also boosted population numbers. The majority of the Mexican population is Roman Catholic, owing to its colonial Spanish background. Spanish is the predominant language, with several regional and local dialects spoken, but a number of indigenous languages, such as Nahuatl, survive and are also spoken around Mexico. One worrying and relatively recent trend in Mexico is the growing share of the population becoming overweight or obese. It is not entirely clear what sort of effect the obesity epidemic is going to have on Mexican population numbers in the long run, but is starting to manifest itself not just in physical appearance, but in the increased rates of heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. In fact, diabetes was one of the top causes of deaths for Mexicans in recent years.

Over the last couple of years, the number of new brewery openings has been at near unprecedented levels; the highest total since the 1880's. And every year, hundreds more are opening. In 2016, the craft brewing industry provided more than 128 thousand jobs across the country.The innovative nature of these craft brewers has driven the market. Many customers have grown tired of light lagers, which is what fueled the craft movement. The concept that every brewer is brewing something new and original has carved a lucrative niche into a once thought-to-be cornered market.Craft breweries have a few things working in their favor, perhaps the most important of which is a customer base that's culturally diverse. Brewers will also focus their marketing efforts on capturing the expanding consumer base represented by female consumers. Craft beer lovers also tend to stay abreast of local trends in the market and are generally eager to try something new. If they like what they taste, they quickly spread the word, meaning hometown customers can quickly become evangelists for a brewery's product as they visit and move to different cities.

With an aging population and greater prevalence of chronic diseases, the need for safe, legal pharmaceutical drugs is constantly rising.Pharmacies and drug stores dispense prescription medications and over-the-counter drugs directly to patients. However, their role is more than one of simple distribution as they dispense medication in specific doses, adhere to optimal conditions of storage and give valuable advice to patients. Pharmacies practice in a wide range of locations such as communities, hospitals, clinics and nursing homes. Other drug retail outlets include supermarkets, and independent and online pharmacies, which offer mail-order drugs to patients, proving especially convenient for those that may be unable to leave their homes.

For 2018, estimates show a sharp increase of over 3.07 percent, before inflation slumps back to around 2 percent in 2021. Oil is keeping everything afloat The economy of the United Arab Emirates heavily relies on oil and its respective revenues. The UAE possess vast stable oil reserves, and crude oil production is steadily increasing. Naturally, oil exports â€?mostly to the Asia-Pacific region â€?are the main economic driver, and the industrial and services sectors have divided generation of GDP almost evenly among themselves. Oil has caused the UAE economy to thrive and caused an impressive trade surplus just a few years ago, before a dramatic (but still not overly concerning) slump. Oil is dragging everything down When oil prices decreased, so did the trade surplus, and inflation mirrored this by skyrocketing from around one percent to over four percent in three years. Another three years later, in 2018, it spiked again at over 3.5 percent â€?another response to dropping oil prices. Diversifying the economy is one way for the UAE to diminish oilâ€™s monopoly; tourism has been a growing industry over the last few years and might just stabilize inflation if another oil price slump hits.

 The amount of fuel used to generate electricity depends on the efficiency of the power plant and the heat content of the fuel. Heat rate measures the efficiency of a generator or power plant and is based on the amount of energy used to generate one kilowatt of electricity. Heat rates (power plant efficiencies) depend on generator type, power plant emission controls, and some other factors. One metric ton of coal can generate 1,927 kilowatt hours of electricity, in comparison to 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas which can generate 99 kilowatt hours. U.S. power plants The largest power plant in the United States is the hydroelectric power plant, Grand Coulee, located in Washington. It has a summer capacity of 7.08 gigawatts.

 The National Football League is one of the most lucrative leagues in the world, with big sponsorship deals and high TV ratings to match. The players within the NFL are compensated handsomely for being part of one of the biggest leagues in the world. The highest paid player in the NFL in 2020 was Dak Prescott of the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys put a franchise tag worth 31.4 million U.S. dollars on Prescott in March 2020, securing his salary for the 2020 season. However, Prescott's season was ended prematurely in Week 5 when he suffered a serious injury to his right ankle in a game against the New York Giants. Quarterbacks earn the big bucks The quarterback is widely considered the most important role in football given that the player is the middle of almost all possession on the offensive end and is the main decision-maker on the pitch. With such a decisive role, it is no wonder that quarterbacks dominate the list of highest paid players in the NFL. Although Dak Prescott has the highest base salary in the league, Tom Brady was able to secure the more money in endorsements.

Crowdfunding failure Putting yourself, your ideas and your projects out into the world and subjecting them to the possibility of public scrutiny is not the easiest pill to swallow for a lot of people, and failure can be hard to accept. The over hundred thousand of unsuccessfully funded projects on US crowdfunding platform Kickstarter are no exception to the crowdfunding industry. Many crowdfunders fail to get the backing they require from investors but that isnâ€™t to say that there arenâ€™t a lot of successfully funded projects emerging from the crowdfunding arena. The concept of crowdfunding is growing all over the world, as is the growth in the number of platforms on which entrepreneurs can get their ideas funded. When embarking upon a crowdfunding campaign, it is important to have a solid plan in place.

 The median age of the population of Belgium was slightly aging from 2010 to 2020 and was predicted to further age in the years to come. The median age divides a population into two equal-sized groups. This single index summarizes the age distribution of Belgians. In other words, half of the Belgian population was younger than 41.87 years old in 2020, and the remaining half was aged over 41.87 years. Median ages of the population around the world Median ages vary greatly across the globe. This measure is influenced by several factors, such as birth rates, social and economic factors, and average life expectancies within countries. From a European perspective, Belgiumâ€™s population median age was slightly lower than in the Netherlands, yet higher than Luxembourg in 2019. In other words, Belgiumâ€™s population was younger than in the Netherlands, yet not as young as in Luxembourg. Currently, Germany had one of the highest median age in Europe alongside with the principality of Monaco. Outside of Europe, however, median age ranged from as low as 15 inâ€¯Nigerâ€¯to 48.4 in Japan. Similar median ages for different population structures Two countries can have similar median ages, yet their populations have different age profiles. For instance, some countries may have large shares of young adults and not many children or older people, whereas some countries can have large shares of children and older people and not many young adults. These differences in terms of structuration of the population can be overlooked when comparing this index between countries. Nonetheless, the median age is crucial to fathom whether a population is aging or not. In Belgium, the population was slowly but steadily aging over the last decade.

No U.S. president or major party nominee was born in Wisconsin or considered it to be their home state. Recent elections Throughout most of its history, Wisconsin was generally regarded as a battleground state, with many elections in the state decided by less than one percent of the popular vote, including four of the six most recent elections. In 2016, Donald Trump defied all major polls relating to Wisconsin when he won the state by a 0.8 percent margin; his victory has been attributed to increased support for the Republican Party among white, working class voters, and the fact that he visited the state six times on the campaign trail while his opponent, Hillary Clinton, did not visit at all. In the 2020 election, however, Joe Biden managed to flip the state blue again, winning by just 20,000 votes (a 0.6 percent margin); the victory has been attributed to Biden's higher favorability among female voters, and increased turnout among black voters. Electoral votes Wisconsin's allocation of electoral votes grew gradually throughout the late nineteenth century, from four votes in 1848, to 13 votes in the early 1900s. Since the 1930s, however, Wisconsin's allocation of electoral votes has gradually fallen to ten, as electoral votes have been redistributed among southern and border states, which tend to have much faster-growing populations.

The majority of the Greek population lives in urbanized areas, but lay-offs and job cuts affect the whole country; the unemployment rate in Greece has been increasing dramatically all over the country and has almost tripled since 2009. Greeceâ€™s economy relies heavily on services; most of Greeceâ€™s gross domestic product is produced in that sector.

Some of the most important industries for Greece are the maritime and shipping industries, as well as tourism. The export of goods has been on the rise, while imports have been decreasing, causing the trade deficit to improve slowly but steadily. Still, Greece is not out of the red and probably wonâ€™t be for some time. National debt in relation to gross domestic product is growing, and Greece is still ranked second on a ranking of countries with the highest public debt worldwide. Austerity measures and rescue packages from the European Union are now put in place to ensure Greeceâ€™s recovery from the crisis.

 In 2020, the estimated youth unemployment rate in Nigeria was at almost 14.2 percent. According to the source, the data are estimates from the International Labour Organization, an agency of the United Nations developing policies to set labor standards. Employment in Nigeria The youth unemployment rate refers to the percentage of the unemployed in the age group of 15 to 24 years as compared to the total labor force. Youth unemployment rates are often higher than overall unemployment rates, which is true in Nigeria as well: the general rate of unemployment was approximately six percent in 2018. One reason for this contrast is that many of the youth under age 24 are studying full-time and are unavailable for work due to this. Education in Nigeria Nigeriaâ€™s population has a large percentage of young inhabitants, and there is a high demand for educational opportunities for its young populace. After severe cuts in governmental aid following a nationwide recession in 2016, Nigeriaâ€™s underfunded higher education system became the focus of ongoing student protests and strikes. Other families have taken a different approach: Nigeria is the top country of origin for international students from the continent of Africa. For example, Nigeria sent over 12,600 students to the U.S. in 2017/18, the most of any African country.

The monthly inflation rate for the United States can be found here. United States urban Consumer Price Index (CPI) The U.S. Consumer Price Index is a measure of change in the price of consumer goods and services purchased by households. The CPI is defined by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics as "a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services." To calculate the CPI, the Bureau of Labor Statistics considers the price of goods and services from various categories: housing, transportation, apparel, food & beverage, medical care, recreation, education and other/uncategorized. The CPI is a useful measure, as it indicates how the cost of urban living in the United States has changed over time, compared to a base period. CPI is also used to calculate inflation, or change in the purchasing power of money. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. urban CPI has been rising steadily since 1992. As of 2019, the CPI was 255.66, up from 214.54 ten years earlier and up from 166.6 twenty years earlier. This indicates the extent to which, compared to a base period 1982-1984 = 100, the price of various goods and services has risen.

A period of continuous deflation between March 2015 and January 2017 preceded a return to a sustained rise of the cost of food from February 2017 onwards. Inflation rate and consumer price index Inflation is commonly measured via the consumer price index, which illustrates changes to prices paid by consumers for a representative basket of goods and services. An annualized percentage change in the price index constitutes a measure of inflation. In order to maintain an inflation rate at a stable level, to enable the general public and businesses to plan their spending, the Government set a two percent inflation target for the Bank of England. European post-referendum comparison Recent increases of food prices were linked to severe weather in 2018 as well as the risk of a no-deal Brexit. In the wake of the referendum held on June 23, 2016, when the majority supported the withdrawal from the European Union (EU), trends with respect to food prices remained analogous in the EU as well as the UK. However, in 2019 the UK is forecast to exhibit a higher CPI inflation rate than Germany and France, the other two largest countries in terms of nominal gross domestic product.

 The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there were millions of smallpox cases every year until the 1970s, when the WHO's eradication program then successfully eliminated the disease in nature. Some academic estimates place smallpox's death toll at 300 million in the twentieth century, and 500 million in its final hundred years of existence. The development of the smallpox vaccination, which was the first successfully developed vaccine (the word vaccination comes from the Latin word for cow;"vacca", as cowpox was used to develop the smallpox vaccine), greatly contributed to the significant decline in infant and child mortality across the globe, and the boom in population growth during the twentieth century. Reported cases In spite of these large numbers, the figures for reported cases was only a tiny fraction of this; for example, the WHO estimates that there were fifty million cases in 1950, however less than one percent of these cases were recorded. In spite of this, the data is still useful for showing how smallpox developed and spread throughout the world; we know that the majority of these cases were recorded in the Indian sub-continent, and that epidemics across Asia drove the number of recorded cases up in the middle of the century. The final naturally-occurring cases were observed in 1977, while the two cases in 1978 were due to a lab accident in England, which resulted in one fatality.

 While nearly two-thirds of Vietnam remains rural, urbanization has grown by seven percent from 2009 to 2019. Political reforms in the 1980s created greater economic stability in Vietnam in the decade that followed and led to higher urbanization.â€¯The growing population of Vietnam, as well as people migrating from rural areas, contributes to an escalating number of inhabitants inâ€¯the country's already crowded cities. Agricultural sector becoming less prominent In 2008, nearly half the population of Vietnam worked in agriculture.â€¯Ten years later, as more people leave rural areas, the service sector is comparable in size, employing roughly a third of the population, while employment in the industry sector has grown to a quarter.â€¯Though agriculture has long had the most workers, the service and industry sectors accounted for larger shares of Vietnamâ€™s GDP from 2007 to 2017. Costs in rural and urban areas In ruralâ€¯areas of Vietnam, investment in agriculture â€?such as the costs of farming â€?was the second-highest expenseâ€¯in 2019.

 This statistic presents Facebook's revenue and net income from 2007 to 2019. Facebook's revenue grew from 7.87 billion in 2013 to 70.7 billion US dollars in 2018. That year, the social network accumulated a net income of 18.49 billion US dollars, ranking first among social media companies in annual revenues. The majority of Facebook revenues are generated via advertising - the shift towards e-commerce and online marketing has never been more evident than in 2016.

 In the build up to each US presidential election, primaries and caucuses are used by the major parties to nominate their candidate for the general election. A primary election is run by the state and local governments, whereas the caucuses are private events that are organized and administered by the respective parties. Primaries involve voters going to the ballot box to decide who their respective candidates will vote for in the respective national conventions. Most states conduct "open primaries" that are open to all eligible voters; while a few states conduct "closed primaries" that are only open to party members. In contrast to this, caucuses involve party members meeting at events where they then discuss who they will vote for, although this system is gradually being phased out, with ten states switching from caucuses to primaries in 2016. Iowa caucus Iowa is generally the first state to select their nominees, and this is done during the Iowa caucus, which has become one of the most important and focal events on the campaign trail. While the winner is not guaranteed the party's nomination, the event helps to establish who the frontrunners in each race are, and in the past, has seen many candidates drop out of the race following poor performances. In the past fifty years, the Iowa Democratic caucus has put forward nine (out of thirteen) candidates who would go on to contest the general election (although two of these primaries were uncontested), while the Iowa Republican caucus has put forward just six (out of twelve) candidates who would receive their party's nomination (with four of these being uncontested). In recent years, many have criticized the influence afforded to the Iowa caucuses, as they do not feel the state (which is ninety percent white) reflects the diversity or demographic makeup of the United States; whereas supporters of the caucuses argue that these events prevent candidates from ignoring voters in smaller and more rural areas in favor of those in larger metropolitan areas, and requires them to conduct politics on a more personal level. New Hampshire primary The New Hampshire Primary usually takes place one week after the Iowa caucuses, and is the second major event in the campaign. As in Iowa, this primary's significance comes from the vast amount of media coverage afforded to it on the campaign trail, and it is often seen as a second (and final) chance for those candidates who underperformed in Iowa. Historically, the New Hampshire primary has a success rate below fifty percent when predicting the Democratic nominee (or forty percent when uncontested races are not included), while it has correctly chosen the Republican nominee on all but two occasions. As this primary is open to all voters, it is seen as a much better indication than Iowa of who will perform well in the general election (especially among undecided voters), and has allowed candidates such as John McCain in 2008 and Bill Clinton in 1992 to stage surprising comebacks in their respective races.

 June 2020, the third full month of the coronavirus pandemic in the Netherlands, reveals a signficant increase in the unemployment rate. In January, the non-seasonally adjusted employment rate for ages 15 until 75 years was said to be 3.3 percent, whereas in March it increased to 3.6 percent. This contrasts the figure for March, which was slightly below than what was predicted back in December 2019, when economic models forecasting an annual average of 3.5 percent. When compared to the same months in previous years, however, unemployment in 2020 was significantly lower. The figure for May 2020, for example, was over half that of May 2015. What are the economic consequences of COVID-19 so far? Domestic sources agree that economic impact is severe, although they have been reluctant to provide precise figures. Some sources outright refused to release data, whereas others stated they were not releasing official forecasts, but estimates. In their opinion, there were too many unknowns. Because of this, numbers on the exact economic consequences of the coronavirus in the Netherlands varied wildly. The CPB or Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (on whose calculations the Dutch government bases its economic policy), for example, predicted GDP decreases between 1.2 percent and eight percent for 2020. CPB based these figures on four possible scenarios, based on how long emergency measures to counter COVID-19 would be in place. Rabobankâ€™s GDP predictions for 2020 changed multiple times over the course of the pandemic, going from a growth of 0.7 percent in early March to a decrease of five percent in mid-April. Which Dutch sectors are hit hardest? Calculations from ABN AMRO economists named leisure and industry as the main victims of COVID-19 in 2020, with both sectors seeing their added value decrease by more than ten percent. This is similar to calculations from Rabobank, which mentioned horeca (hotels, restaurants, bars) and construction, and added that these sectors would not be recovered by 2021 from all the damage suffered in 2020.

 This statistic shows the growth of Switzerland's population from 2009 to 2019, in comparison to the previous year. In 2019, Switzerland's population grew by approximately 0.71 percent compared to the previous year. See Switzerland's population figures for comparison. The Swiss population The Swiss population has been growing at a steady rate for the past few years; in general the country has experienced around a one percent population growth rate since the 1970s. Between 2004 and 2007, population growth was slightly below one percent, but has rebounded since then. This growth is supported by immigration, as the fertility rate is well below the replacement rate. The countryâ€™s strong and stable economy and the free movement of people within the European Union has helped attract foreigners. In 2015, the population of Switzerland was around 8.25 million and its foreign-born population amounted to 2.26 million people that same year, meaning that around 1 out of every four people in Switzerland are of foreign origin. But even if you are born in Switzerland, you are not automatically granted Swiss nationality, and many people who are of â€œforeignâ€?origin were actually born in Switzerland but keep the nationality of their parents or do not go through what can be a lengthy process to obtain Swiss nationality. Another characteristic of the Swiss population is that Swiss people are getting older. Due to its high standard of living, Switzerland has one of the highest life expectancies in the world, and the median age of the population is now estimated at 42.3 years.

 This graph shows the amount of revenue that Apple generated through sales of the iPod each quarter from the first quarter of 2006. In the first quarter of 2013, sales increased again compared to previous quarters and revenue from this product came to more than 2 billion U.S. dollars. As of the first quarter of 2014 however, revenue was down by more than half to 970 million U.S. dollars. Annual and quarterly iPod unit sales The Apple iPod - additional information The launch of the iPod digital portable music device in 2001 was a breakthrough for Apple and a revolutionary move for the consumer electronics market. The company had not had widespread success for some time, but the iPod paved the way for other innovative and extremely successful products, such as the iPhone, launched in 2007, and the iPad, released in 2010. The first version of the iPod had a 5 GB hard drive, which could be used for storing music, but could also serve as an external data storage device. iPod sales were slow at first, due to the deviceâ€™s need for a Macintosh computer and its iTunes software. However, the company continued to update the product, adding newer versions, such as the iPod Shuffle, iPod Nano and iPod Touch, with improved design, features and hard drive capacity. By its 2006 fiscal year, Apple iPod sales reached 40 million units worldwide. Sales peaked in Appleâ€™s first financial quarter of 2009, when over 22 million iPods were sold worldwide. At that point, iPod sales accounted for over 28 percent of Apple's total revenue, but only five years later, this share had decreased to less than one percent. This decline in iPod revenue is in part due to the launch of the iPhone and other smartphones, which made having a music player redundant, due to the integrated music-playing features of a new generation of mobile phones. In 2009, two years after the launch of the iPhone, the iPod was still the more successful of the two in regards to unit sales. Nevertheless, by the fourth quarter of 2014, iPhone sales had increased to almost 40 million units, while only 2.5 million iPods were sold. Starting the following fiscal year, Apple stopped reporting iPod sales as a separate segment in its financial reports.

In recent years, the performance of Deloitte in the United States improved year-on-year - revenue increased by more than one billion U.S. dollars between 2017 and 2018. The growing number of employees at Deloitte provides another indication of the firmâ€™s stature throughout North and South America. Deloitte employed over 139,000 staff members across the Americas in 2019 â€?an increase of 11 percent on the previous year â€?and of all the leading accounting firms in the United States, Deloitte employed by far the most members of staff. The Big Eight of the Eighties There are four major accounting firms in the world today: Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Ernst and Young (EY), and Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler (KPMG). However, the professional accounting landscape was far different for much of the 20th century, with eight firms competing for the same major clients. The growth of multinational clients in a global economy changed the industry during the 1980s. In order to gain a strong foothold in the new international market, two mega mergers took place in 1989 that involved four of the Big Eight firms: Ernst and Whinney merged with Arthur Young to form Ernst and Young, and Deloitte Haskins and Sells merged with Touche Ross to form Deloitte and Touche. This was the start of the Big Eight gradually being reduced to the Big Four.

 The price of solar photovoltaic modules in the United States has seen a fairly consistent decrease over the last few years. In Q2 2020, U.S. multi module prices averaged 0.19 U.S. dollars per watt, in comparison to 0.63 U.S. dollars per watt in Q1 2016. Solar system pricing has fallen in all markets, including residential, non-residential, and utility markets. The decline is largely due to declining hardware costs, primarily from lower module prices. The oversupply of modules due to decreasing demand from China lowered module prices; in turn, this has helped to alleviate the tariffs that were implemented on Chinese module exports to the United States. Solar price variations Solar photovoltaics prices in the U.S. are consistently low, in comparison to many other countries. The price of solar in U.S. states can also vary, mostly due to the cost of electricity. The components that are used in solar energy systems may also impact the price of solar photovoltaics. Falling global demand, high supply levels, and the resulting bidding competition have also pushed prices lower.

 Throughout the 2018 calendar year, Shazam reportedly had 478 million annual active users, an impressive increase from the 400 million recorded in 2017. Some sources have attributed this rapid growth to the recent acquisition of Shazam by tech giant Apple, a deal which cost Apple 400 million U.S. dollars. Apple acquired Shazam in late 2018, a move considered controversial by some because of the effect the acquisition could have on competitors. Discussions about the acquisition began in 2017, and it was noted that Shazam would no longer refer users to Spotify or Google Play Music and instead serve to appease Apple Music users. The acquisition was investigated by the European Commission in early 2018 but approved in September of that year. What is Shazam? Shazam is a song finder app which can be used to identify music, TV shows, movies, and even advertising. The app's built-in microphone accesses and gathers data on audio samples, analyzes them and then searches for a match in its vast database of content. The service is appealing to consumers in that it offers a simple solution to a common problem. When users are curious about the name of a song, be it in a bar, restaurant, store, or anywhere else playing a song the user wants to know the name of, Shazam can be used to identify the track that is currently playing, providing the volume is high enough and the ambient sound is not too intrusive. Some songs have been identified by Shazam tens of millions of times, including tracks from late Swedish DJ Avicii and British singer songwriter Ed Sheeran. Whilst background noise or ambient sound can detrimentally affect Shazam's ability to identify the music, the service is far more sophisticated than when it started out in 2002. Initially, users could simply dial the number '2580' on their phone, hold the device close to the music source and wait to receive an SMS message with the song title and artist name. The app was among the first to be included in the Apple App Store, and by 2011 could also be used to detect ads and TV shows. Shazam is now one of the leading music apps in the Apple App Store worldwide. Shazam is not the only music recognition app on the market, but is certainly one of the most well-known. Other applications which can be used for song identification include SoundHound (Shazam's biggest competitor), Musixmatch, BeatFind, Google Music Recognition, and Soly, to name but a few.

Most mothers between 25 and 34 years old In 2016, the largest number of babies born in Belgium were born to mothers aged between 25 and 34, although 28 children were also born to mothers 50 years and older. One girl younger than 13 also gave birth that year. 
 Between 1820 and 1957, at least 400,000 people migrated from Poland to the United States.
